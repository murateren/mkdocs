It also represents a great risk, as a tool that is easily appropriated by authorities for targeted and mass surveillance.<!-- more --></p>\n<p>The perennial question when it comes to protests is whether you should bring your phone at all. If you leave your phone at home, that is probably the safest your data will get, and you will be at very low risk of being tracked by mass surveillance tools. On the other hand, your phone is a critical resource when it comes to coordinating with others, getting updates on the protest from social media, or simply documenting what is going on with your phone's camera.</p>\n<p>If possible, bringing a separate device like a \"burner phone,\" an old phone you can reset, or even a regular old-fashioned camera is a much better option than bringing your primary phone. Any data you don't bring with you can't be taken from you at the scene.</p>\n<p>However, getting access to or affording devices like these aren't a realistic option for many people. Whether you decide to take your smartphone or a secondary smartphone with you to the event, this guide will cover how to maximize that device's security and minimize risks to your privacy.</p>\n<p><strong>Update (2025-01-27):</strong> This article has been updated based on some community <a href=\"https://discuss.privacyguides.net/t/24316\">feedback</a>, notably I added the <a href=\"#burner-phones\">Burner Phones</a>, <a href=\"#minimize-your-stored-data\">Minimize Your Stored Data</a>, <a href=\"#use-public-wi-fi\">Use Public Wi-Fi</a>, and <a href=\"#check-your-keyboard\">Check Your Keyboard</a> sections.</p>\n<h2 id=\"your-risks-at-a-protest\">Your Risks at a Protest</h2>\n<p>There are plenty of risks you should consider if you use your smartphone at a protest. We are going to try and cover the following in this guide:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Losing your device.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Authorities confiscating your smartphone.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Service disruption, either due to intentional interference by authorities or caused by networks being overloaded by large groups of people.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Targeted surveillance:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Disrupting your service.</li>\n<li>Blocking delivery of calls/<abbr title=\"Short Message Service (standard text messaging)\">SMS</abbr> to your number.</li>\n<li>Monitoring your unencrypted traffic.</li>\n<li>Monitoring communications over local radios like walkie-talkies, etc.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Mass surveillance:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Interference with web services. Popular communication platforms like Twitter or TikTok could be throttled or blocked.</li>\n<li>Interference with messengers and voice services like Signal or WhatsApp.</li>\n<li>Authorities could use public Wi-Fi networks in the area to monitor traffic and identify nearby devices.</li>\n<li>Cell phone companies could provide records to authorities of devices near cell towers in the area to track and identify protesters.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Like all of our guides, we are going to cover the general best practices and provide helpful tips, but your individual situation may be different. You should always research and plan according to what you specifically are doing, and if you need legal advice you should always consult a qualified and licensed attorney.</p>\n<h2 id=\"burner-phones\">\"Burner Phones\"</h2>\n<p>Cell phones are generally tracked by law enforcement using two identifiers:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Your <strong><abbr title=\"International Mobile Subscriber Identity\">IMSI</abbr></strong>, which uniquely identifies your <abbr title=\"Subscriber Identity Module\">SIM</abbr> card</li>\n<li>Your <strong><abbr title=\"International Mobile Equipment Identity\">IMEI</abbr></strong>, which uniquely identifies your phone</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Thus, simply using a prepaid <abbr title=\"Subscriber Identity Module\">SIM</abbr> in your primary/personal device is not a foolproof method of avoiding tracking, because your <abbr title=\"International Mobile Equipment Identity\">IMEI</abbr> is still correlatable between networks.</p>\n<p>Buying a secondary, disposable device is an option that will provide you with much greater protection than bringing your personal device. However, if the threat you face is serious enough that you feel the need to do this, you should strongly consider not bringing a phone at all. Properly securing a disposable/burner phone is fairly challenging and may not be worth it.</p>\n<p>If you <em>do</em> buy a secondary device for this purpose, you should buy it in-person, with <strong>cash</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Do not activate or power it on at home</strong>. The location of a phone is tracked by network carriers for at least a year at minimum, but you should assume that location history is just kept forever. Therefore, you should activate and set up the device in a very public place that is not significant to your daily life, then always keep it powered off at locations associated with you. You don't want the phone's location to ever be recorded at your home or workplace.</p>\n<p>If possible, you should try to purchase and set up this phone well in advance. This certainly depends on your plans, but spreading out your purchase, activation, and use of the device makes it less easy to detect. It also makes it less likely that the store you bought the phone from still has security footage of your purchase.</p>\n<p>You will also want to make sure you do not identify yourself when purchasing a cellular plan. This is highly dependent on your country, but many prepaid plans will not require any identification to activate. There are also some global eSIM providers which will accept payment without the need to identify yourself to them.</p>\n<p>One last thing: Your secondary device should still be a reasonably modern smartphone. The security measures we cover below regarding <a href=\"#consider-your-phones-security-patches\">hardware and software security</a> still apply. Smartphones are more secure against the sort of threats that activists are likely to face\u2014such as someone trying to crack into your device's data\u2014than a simple/feature/\"dumb\" phone will be. They also have many more options for secure &amp; encrypted communication methods that we'll cover below as well.</p>\n<p>Using a secondary device only at the protest allows you to leave your primary device powered on and at home. This potentially provides some plausible deniability, if someone requests the location of your phone during the time of the event later.</p>\n<h2 id=\"secure-your-device\">Secure Your Device</h2>\n<p>If your phone falls into the wrong hands, the information on it could be hugely damaging to yourself or others. Make sure you've taken the necessary steps to prevent it from being broken into.</p>\n<h3 id=\"use-a-strong-screen-lock\">Use a Strong Screen Lock</h3>\n<p>At a bare minimum, you should use a 6-digit PIN, but ideally you should protect your phone with an alphanumeric passphrase. This prevents people from trivially accessing your data, and additionally protects your data with strong encryption.</p>\n<p>Barring a massive security exploit (more on this <a href=\"#consider-your-phones-security-patches\">later</a>), most law enforcement tools work by essentially brute-forcing your PIN, running tons of guesses until it gets one right. This makes a long and unique passphrase your strongest protection against your data being stolen by people in possession of your device.</p>\n<p>In the United States and many other countries it is legal to refuse to unlock your phone or provide your passcode to law enforcement. <strong>Know your rights</strong> wherever you're located before attending a protest, so you aren't blindly following orders later.</p>\n<h3 id=\"disable-biometric-authentication\">Disable Biometric Authentication</h3>\n<p>We commonly recommend using biometric features like Face ID or Touch ID to prevent \"shoulder surfing\" attacks, where an attacker steals your PIN by discreetly watching you enter it, or where your PIN is recorded by surveillance cameras in the area.</p>\n<p><strong>However</strong>, in this situation it may make more sense to disable biometric authentication. Authorities are trained and known to use biometrics quickly to forcefully unlock your device, so you should be mindful of this fact when deciding what to do. If you disable biometrics, be wary of shoulder surfing attacks and prying eyes by obscuring or covering your phone whenever you unlock it.</p>\n<p>Whatever you do, make sure you know how to quickly shut down your phone or disable biometrics at a moment's notice. Many phones have begun replacing the standard \"hold down the power button\" function with voice assistants or other features, so practice performing the actual shutdown method beforehand to familiarize yourself.</p>\n<p>Modern iPhones require you to hold down the side button and either volume button before the power-off slider appears. Even if you don't get a chance to slide to power off, getting to this screen will at least disable biometric authentication, making your phone a bit more secure than it otherwise might be.</p>\n<p>In the United States, it is still a legal gray area when it comes to whether law enforcement can force you to use biometrics, but many court decisions have leaned toward saying they <strong>can</strong> compel you to use your fingerprint. Using a passphrase and disabling biometrics gives you more robust 5th Amendment rights. In other countries you should again familiarize yourself with your rights in this scenario, so that you can make the most informed decision.</p>\n<h3 id=\"hide-your-notifications\">Hide Your Notifications</h3>\n<p>Even with your device locked, law enforcement can see everything you're up to simply by scrolling through your notifications. Reducing the amount of information accessible on the lock screen improves your security and the security of those you're messaging, so make sure your notifications are only visible when your device is unlocked.</p>\n<p>On an iPhone:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Open <strong>Settings</strong></li>\n<li>Navigate to <strong>Notifications</strong></li>\n<li>Navigate to <strong>Show Previews</strong></li>\n<li>Select <strong>Never</strong> (or, <strong>When Unlocked</strong>)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>On Android:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Open <strong>Settings</strong></li>\n<li>Navigate to <strong>Notifications</strong></li>\n<li>Touch <strong>Notifications on lock screen</strong><ul>\n<li>Select <strong>Don't show any notifications</strong></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Switch <strong>Sensitive notifications</strong> to <strong>off</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"minimize-your-stored-data\">Minimize Your Stored Data</h3>\n<p>The best way to protect your data is to not have it on your phone in the first place. If you're using a secondary device, simply don't install anything other than what will be absolutely necessary during the protest, like a secure messenger.</p>\n<p>Otherwise, delete any cloud storage apps you don't need access to during the protest. If you're able to delete an app and then download it later and log in without experiencing any data loss, then that app probably doesn't <em>need</em> to be on your phone all the time.</p>\n<p>Some <a href=\"https://www.privacyguides.org/en/passwords/\">password managers</a> have the option to temporarily remove certain vaults from your devices, 1Password calls this <a href=\"https://support.1password.com/travel-mode/\">Travel Mode</a> for example. You can do this manually as well, by having a separate password manager or vault with only the essentials you will need at the time, and removing your primary password manager from your device for the duration of the event.</p>\n<h3 id=\"disable-lock-screen-actions\">Disable Lock Screen Actions</h3>\n<p>In a similar vein, any functionality you have enabled while your device is unlocked can pose a security risk. It is always best practice to reduce your <abbr title=\"The total number of possible entry points for unauthorized access to a system\">attack surface</abbr> by disabling these options whenever possible. Even though these features are typically designed to not pose a security risk to your data, they have been known to be exploited in the past to bypass lock screens and other security features.</p>\n<p>On an iPhone:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Open <strong>Settings</strong></li>\n<li>Navigate to <strong>Face ID &amp; Passcode</strong></li>\n<li>Scroll to the <strong>Allow Access When Locked</strong> section</li>\n<li>Switch all features you don't need <strong>off</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>On Android, disabling functionality while the phone is locked will vary widely by manufacturer. Some like Samsung provide more flexible options in their lock screen settings, but others like Google do not provide the option to disable the quick settings panel or other similar features.</p>\n<h3 id=\"avoid-external-storage\">Avoid External Storage</h3>\n<p>Your Android phone might have the option to store files or photos on a microSD card, but these cards are not always subject to the same encryption standards as your phone's built-in storage. You should check whether your microSD card can be encrypted in your phone's settings, although this will prevent it from being read by other devices like your computer later.</p>\n<p>Additionally, even <em>if</em> it's encrypted, it still won't benefit from the same security protections that your phone's built-in storage provides, such as advanced brute-force protections. Ideally you should remove all external storage devices from your phone during the event, and save photos, videos, and other files to your phone's encrypted internal storage.</p>\n<h3 id=\"consider-your-phones-security-patches\">Consider Your Phone's Security Patches</h3>\n<p>Exploits against smartphones are discovered on a very regular basis, and spyware companies that work with law enforcement\u2014like Cellebrite\u2014abuse these exploits to crack into stolen devices. If your phone is no longer receiving regular updates from its manufacturer, you are in a very dangerous position as you may be vulnerable to the exploits used.</p>\n<p>In general, we consider the latest iPhone and latest Google Pixel to be the most secured against this sort of threat. You can increase your security further by using a <a href=\"https://www.privacyguides.org/en/android/distributions/\">hardened alternative operating system</a> on your Google Pixel.</p>\n<p>Robust security information about phones from other manufacturers is less common. If you use a different device you may still consider the risks to be worth it, but if confiscation is of <em>particular</em> concern to you, or especially if your phone no longer receives security patches, you may want to consider leaving the phone at home.</p>\n<h2 id=\"protect-against-surveillance\">Protect Against Surveillance</h2>\n<h3 id=\"disable-airdrop\">Disable AirDrop</h3>\n<p>One of the most innocuous features enabled on millions of iPhones is also one of the most dangerous for those seeking to protect their privacy in public. Apple's AirDrop protocol <a href=\"https://www.usenix.org/system/files/sec21-heinrich.pdf\">uses</a> trivially bypassed security measures that authorities like the Chinese government have openly <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/01/hackers-can-id-unique-apple-airdrop-users-chinese-authorities-claim-to-do-just-that/\">bragged</a> about cracking to identify users since at least 2022.</p>\n<p>You should assume that any device with AirDrop enabled is constantly broadcasting your name, email address, and phone number to everyone around you, <strong>even if</strong> you have it set to \"Contacts Only.\" Apple has known about this <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/23/airdrop-researchers-security-flaw/\">flaw</a> since 2019 and has not issued any fix.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Open the <strong>Settings</strong> app</li>\n<li>Navigate to <strong>General</strong></li>\n<li>Navigate to <strong>AirDrop</strong></li>\n<li>Select <strong>Receiving Off</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"lock-down-your-network\">Lock Down Your Network</h3>\n<p>Your phone signals can be used to track you even if you don't make a call or send a text. Some law enforcement agencies use \"stingrays,\" devices which can impersonate a cell tower to track visitors to an area. It is speculated that more advanced ones can intercept unencrypted text messages and phone calls as well, making the use of an <a href=\"#use-signal\">encrypted messenger</a> during the event even more critical.</p>\n<p>While the capabilities of the most modern ones isn't fully known, you should definitely protect yourself from the subset of stingrays which abuse the lower security standards of older, 2G networks.</p>\n<p>On Android:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Open <strong>Settings</strong></li>\n<li>Navigate to <strong>Network &amp; internet</strong></li>\n<li>Navigate to <strong>SIMs</strong></li>\n<li>Select your carrier or <abbr title=\"Subscriber Identity Module\">SIM</abbr> card</li>\n<li>Switch <strong>Allow 2G</strong> to <strong>off</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>You might also consider installing Privacy Cell (<a href=\"https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.stoutner.privacycell/\">F-Droid</a> / <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.stoutner.privacycell\">Google Play</a>), an app that tells you whether you are connected to a cell network using the most modern security. Even the \"5G\" indicator on your phone alone doesn't guarantee you are using the latest-generation protocol.</p>\n<p>On iPhone:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Open <strong>Settings</strong></li>\n<li>Navigate to <strong>Privacy &amp; Security</strong></li>\n<li>Navigate to <strong>Lockdown Mode</strong></li>\n<li>Select <strong>Turn On Lockdown Mode</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Note that enabling <a href=\"https://www.privacyguides.org/articles/2022/10/27/macos-ventura-privacy-security-updates/#lockdown-mode\">Lockdown Mode</a> on an iPhone will change a variety of settings to harden its security. Many of them are smart improvements, but certain apps and features <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/HT212650\">won't work</a> normally, so read the previous links here for more details.</p>\n<h3 id=\"use-airplane-mode-frequently\">Use Airplane Mode Frequently</h3>\n<p>Even after mitigating the risks of 2G networks, your cellular activity can still be tracked. If not by law enforcement then by your carrier, who will likely be responsive to law enforcement's requests for data after the fact.</p>\n<p>To prevent this, you should keep your phone turned off or use Airplane Mode to disable cellular connections whenever possible. Ideally you should only connect to networks in an emergency situation to communicate with others in your group, otherwise keeping messages and network transmissions to a minimum is key.</p>\n<p>If you absolutely need internet connectivity, and if it's possible, you should keep Airplane Mode on and connect to a public Wi-Fi network instead, which brings me to:</p>\n<h3 id=\"use-public-wi-fi\">Use Public Wi-Fi</h3>\n<p>If you're able, scope out businesses in the area that provide public Wi-Fi in advance. This is better than using cellular service, because less information about your device is shared with Wi-Fi networks as opposed to cell towers. Most modern phones support <abbr title=\"Media Access Control\">MAC</abbr> address randomization, which makes it even harder to correlate your cell phone's connections between different Wi-Fi access points.</p>\n<p>There is a danger that public Wi-Fi services will be set up by authorities or others in the area to track protesters. You could consider using a <a href=\"https://www.privacyguides.org/en/vpn/\"><abbr title=\"Virtual Private Network\">VPN</abbr> service</a> while connected to them to minimize the amount of metadata about your traffic that the Wi-Fi operator is able to collect.</p>\n<h3 id=\"disable-location-services\">Disable Location Services</h3>\n<p>If you have to keep your device powered on and connected, you can at least minimize the number of parties who have access to your location data. Be mindful of apps that you choose to share your location with, and consider disabling location services entirely while you're at the event.</p>\n<p>On an iPhone:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Open <strong>Settings</strong></li>\n<li>Navigate to <strong>Privacy &amp; Security</strong></li>\n<li>Navigate to <strong>Location Services</strong></li>\n<li>Switch <strong>Location Services</strong> to <strong>off</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>On Android:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Open <strong>Settings</strong></li>\n<li>Navigate to <strong>Location</strong></li>\n<li>Switch <strong>Use location</strong> to <strong>off</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>If you use an Android phone, you should also check your Google account settings to <a href=\"https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/3118687\">ensure location history is disabled</a>. Google is frequently tapped by law enforcement to provide location data, because they don't protect your personal information with strong, zero-knowledge encryption.</p>\n<h3 id=\"check-your-keyboard\">Check Your Keyboard</h3>\n<p>An often overlooked security risk is the software keyboard installed on your device. The best encrypted messenger in the world is no match for all of your inputs being read by third-parties as you type them.</p>\n<p>If you are on <a href=\"#consider-your-phones-security-patches\">GrapheneOS</a>, the default keyboard from <abbr title=\"Android Open Source Project\">AOSP</abbr> that it comes with makes no internet connections, so if you don't install a third-party keyboard you should be fine. Most other Android users are using Google's <em>Gboard</em>, which does make internet connections you may decide you don't trust, so you could consider installing an offline alternative. iOS users are able to control whether their third-party keyboard has network access in their system settings, although it may be wiser to not install a third-party keyboard in the first place.</p>\n<p>This is <a href=\"https://xcancel.com/RealSexyCyborg/status/1197695344575799296\">particularly relevant</a> to people typing in languages like Chinese or others where you use an Input Method Editor (IME) to convert Latin letters to characters in the target language. These IMEs are very often third-party apps that have full internet access.</p>\n<h2 id=\"other-tips\">Other Tips</h2>\n<h3 id=\"use-signal\">Use Signal</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.privacyguides.org/en/real-time-communication/#signal\"><strong>Signal</strong></a> is the most secure app for sending text messages and making voice calls with others. It is also impossible to configure Signal to lower its encryption security or other security standards, so you know that everyone in your group is using settings that are safe by default.</p>\n<p>You should turn on disappearing messages with a reasonably short interval for sensitive communications. You can do this by default in the Privacy section of Signal's app settings, and you can also do it on a per-conversation basis in each conversation's settings panel. This way there is a time limit for an attacker to crack your phone and extract your messages before they permanently disappear.</p>\n<p>Signal is battle-tested for this situation. <a href=\"https://signal.org/bigbrother/\">Signal has responded to 6 government requests</a> since 2016, and in each case the only information they were able to provide was at most:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Whether the user was registered with Signal</li>\n<li>When that user registered with Signal</li>\n<li>When that user connected to Signal last</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Keep in mind that using Signal could still expose your phone's location, simply due to making a network request as we covered above. You should still keep your phone in <a href=\"#use-airplane-mode-frequently\">Airplane Mode</a> and minimize the use of Signal or any other networked app during the event.</p>\n<p>There <em>are</em> other <a href=\"https://www.privacyguides.org/en/real-time-communication/\">encrypted messengers</a>, some of them even making use of technologies developed by Signal. However, they all come with trade-offs that could easily compromise your security. WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger are end-to-end encrypted for example, but they collect copious amounts of <em>metadata</em> about your messages, such as whom you're sending them to, when you're sending them, your location when you're sending them, etc. Apple's iMessage service in the Messages app has strong encryption but similar metadata concerns, and only works if everyone in your group has an iPhone.</p>\n<h3 id=\"protect-your-access-to-information\">Protect Your Access to Information</h3>\n<p>Phones can be easily lost, taken, broken, or they can simply run out of juice. Bring a spare mobile battery or a charged power bank with you, and try to minimize your phone usage to preserve power. You should also make sure your mobile plan is topped up and you have enough mobile data prior to the event.</p>\n<p>You should also write down the number of an emergency contact or a lawyer on a physical piece of paper, or <a href=\"https://xcancel.com/madeleine_rae/status/1266528386878443522\">even</a> in Sharpie on your arm. You'll want this information easily accessible if you're arrested regardless of your phone's state or location.</p>\n<h3 id=\"change-your-camera-settings\">Change Your Camera Settings</h3>\n<p>Check your camera settings for things which may draw unwanted attention, like the flash or a shutter sound. You should go through these settings in advance and configure it for the safest possible use.</p>\n<h3 id=\"back-up-your-data\">Back Up Your Data</h3>\n<p>You should be prepared to have your phone taken or lost during a protest. You can limit the potential costs and headache to you if this happens by making sure you have an updated, encrypted backup of your data.</p>\n<p>If you have an iPhone, you can make a local backup to a macOS computer or a Windows computer with iTunes. You can also back up to iCloud, but these backups are only secure if you enable <a href=\"https://www.privacyguides.org/en/os/ios-overview/#icloud\">Advanced Data Protection</a> on your iCloud account. We strongly encourage <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/108756\">enabling Advanced Data Protection</a> for all iCloud users in any case, as it protects not only device backups but most iCloud account data as well.</p>\n<p>The backup situation on Android is not nearly as robust unfortunately, but you can back up photos and files with a variety of services. If you use an online backup service we recommend choosing one with strong, zero-knowledge encryption so that the service provider is unable to access your data.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.privacyguides.org/en/photo-management/\">Recommended Photo Backup Services</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.privacyguides.org/en/cloud/\">Recommended Cloud Drive Services</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.privacyguides.org/en/file-sharing/\">Recommended File Sync Services</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"at-the-protest\">At The Protest</h2>\n<h3 id=\"keep-your-device-locked\">Keep Your Device Locked</h3>\n<p>You should always use your camera to take pictures or videos while your phone is locked, in case your device is taken while filming. This is easier if you've <a href=\"#disable-biometric-authentication\">disabled biometrics</a>, because Face ID or similar features might unlock your device automatically when you don't want that to happen.</p>\n<p>On an iPhone you can hold down the camera icon on the lock screen to open the camera without unlocking your device. You could also configure the Action Button to open the camera, or use the dedicated camera button on the latest iPhone model.</p>\n<p>On a Google Pixel and most other Android devices, double-tapping the power button will open the camera without needing to unlock your device.</p>\n<p>You should learn and/or set up device shortcuts to do things quickly, ideally while the device remains locked whenever possible, and ensure you're familiar with the shortcuts before the event.</p>\n<h3 id=\"have-a-backup-communications-network\">Have a Backup Communications Network</h3>\n<p>In the event of an internet blackout, it might be a good idea to have a backup network prepared, organized with other attendees. Messaging apps like <a href=\"https://www.privacyguides.org/en/real-time-communication/#briar\">Briar</a> can operate in a local mesh mode, connecting to other devices in the area with Bluetooth or local Wi-Fi connections instead of relying on centralized internet services. Another newer option is <a href=\"https://meshtastic.org/\">Meshtastic</a>, which uses peer-to-peer/mesh radio that is much more reliable than using either Wi-Fi or Bluetooth, but requires purchasing dedicated hardware that you connect to your phone.</p>\n<p>You might also want to consider local radios like walkie-talkies, although keep in mind these devices are nearly always unencrypted and can be easily monitored by others, so you won't want to use them to transmit sensitive information.</p>\n<h2 id=\"after-the-event\">After The Event</h2>\n<h3 id=\"if-your-phone-was-taken\">If Your Phone Was Taken</h3>\n<p>If you lose your phone, you may be able to locate or wipe your phone remotely depending on the model. Here are some instructions for common devices you can try:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://support.google.com/android/answer/3265955?hl=en\">Finding a lost Android device</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/104978\">Finding a lost iPhone</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you were logged in to any online services on your phone, you should try and get them signed out. On many social media websites for example, you can go to your account's settings to see what devices are signed in and revoke their access remotely.</p>\n<p>Please be aware of the <strong>legal consequences</strong> of these actions. Wiping your device or revoking online account access could lead to obstruction of justice or destruction of evidence charges in some jurisdictions. You should always speak with your licensed attorney before deciding how to proceed. If your phone was taken by law enforcement you may have legal recourse to get it back.</p>\n<h3 id=\"be-mindful-of-others\">Be Mindful of Others</h3>\n<p>If you post your photos online, be mindful of identifiable faces or other characteristics of your fellow protesters or bystanders. Law enforcement or vigilantes use these photos to track down other attendees and arrest or harass them.</p>\n<p>To prevent this, you can obscure the faces of anyone in the image. Most phones have <a href=\"https://www.privacyguides.org/en/os/ios-overview/#redacting-elements-in-images\">built-in photo editing tools</a> that allow you to draw on an image. Blurring can sometimes be reversed, so blocking it out entirely is generally preferable.</p>\n<p>Be careful of the editing tools you use, and don't select highlighters or other semi-transparent editing tools. Even if you scribble over an area of a photo multiple times with a dark/black \"highlighter\" tool until it <em>appears</em> black, that can often be reversed with photo editing software by adjusting the contrast of the image. Using a shape/rectangle tool to draw a black box over areas you wish to redact is much better than trying to manually cross out image elements with drawing tools.</p>\n<p>The Signal app also has built-in tools for photo editing and blurring. You can send a photo to yourself in the \"Notes to Self\" chat, then save the edited image from that chat for sharing.

We will suspend posters who repeatedly engage in bad faith arguments.</p>\n<p>For almost everyone here, you won't see any negative impacts of this new policy. It is simply designed to allow us to remove the small number of people who occasionally join to spread unproductive negativity in the privacy space, at the expense of legitimate projects making the world a better place. Hopefully you will notice improvements in discussion quality overall.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>To give an example, there are two specific behaviors we want to discourage with this new policy.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>The constant use of words like \"shilling,\" \"fanboys,\" etc. to describe people who have a difference in opinion to your own is not acceptable.</p>\n<p>To \"<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shill\">shill</a>\" something is to promote something you have an employer relationship or some other actual conflict of interest with. To accuse someone in our community of being a planted shill without any evidence, simply because they like something that you dislike, is both a serious accusation and a bad-faith argument.</p>\n<p>Even the use of terms like these informally to describe people who like a certain product more than others is disrespectful, and sows uncertainty and distrust within our community, so it will no longer be tolerated.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A very small portion of GrapheneOS community members continually attempt to derail any conversations mentioning GrapheneOS with irrelevant details and confrontational attitudes.</p>\n<p>This is not a reflection on the GrapheneOS project itself, but unfortunately this has become a repeated situation with certain community members of this specific project more than anyone else, so we have to call it out.</p>\n<p>Making unfounded accusations against Privacy Guides community members of harassment towards GrapheneOS simply because they presented their criticism of the project is not a good faith argument. Similarly, presenting unverified statements from the GrapheneOS community as factual has led to misinformation being spread in the past. It is critical to always differentiate between opinions/beliefs and factual information.</p>\n<p><strong>Privacy Guides community spaces are not GrapheneOS discussion forums, and the drama from their community is not automatically on-topic in ours.</strong> Please do not make new topics in our forum that simply link to drama posts from the GrapheneOS community. A good rule of thumb is that unless a post from GrapheneOS is specifically talking about GrapheneOS-specific, privacy-related functionality and not about other projects/software/etc., it is probably off-topic here.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Share this page:</strong><br />\n<a class=\"md-button\" href=\"https://x.com/intent/tweet?text=Blog%20Post%20Title%20Placeholder&amp;url=https%3A//murateren.github.io/mynotes/blog/2025/05/01/bad-faith-arguments/&amp;hashtags=PrivacyGuides&amp;via=erenm\" style=\"margin-right: 1em;\">Share on <span class=\"twemoji\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path d=\"M18.901 1.153h3.68l-8.04 9.19L24 22.846h-7.406l-5.8-7.584-6.638 7.584H.474l8.6-9.83L0 1.154h7.594l5.243 6.932ZM17.61 20.644h2.039L6.486 3.24H4.298Z\"/></svg></span></a>\n<a class=\"md-button\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&amp;url=https%3A//murateren.github.io/mynotes/blog/2025/05/01/bad-faith-arguments/&amp;title=Blog%20Post%20Title%20Placeholder&amp;summary=Blog%20Post%20Description%20Placeholder\">Share on <span class=\"twemoji\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path d=\"M19 3a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H5a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V5a2 2 0 0 1 2-2zm-.5 15.5v-5.3a3.26 3.26 0 0 0-3.26-3.26c-.85 0-1.84.52-2.32 1.3v-1.11h-2.79v8.37h2.79v-4.93c0-.77.62-1.4 1.39-1.4a1.4 1.4 0 0 1 1.4 1.4v4.93zM6.88 8.56a1.68 1.68 0 0 0 1.68-1.68c0-.93-.75-1.69-1.68-1.69a1.69 1.69 0 0 0-1.69 1.69c0 .93.76 1.68 1.69 1.68m1.39 9.94v-8.37H5.5v8.37z\"/></svg></span></a></p>", "image": "https://murateren.github.io/mynotes//assets/images/social/bad-faith-arguments.png", "date_published": "2025-05-01T10:30:00+00:00", "authors": [{"name": "Murat Eren"}], "tags": ["Announcements", "Privacy Guides"]}, {"id": "https://murateren.github.io/mynotes/blog/2025/05/01/biometrics-explained/", "url": "https://murateren.github.io/mynotes/blog/2025/05/01/biometrics-explained/", "title": "Blog Post Title Placeholder", "content_html": "<h1 id=\"biometrics-explained\">Biometrics Explained</h1>\n<p><img alt=\"Glowing fingerprint on glass\" src=\"../../../../assets/images/biometrics-explained/biometrics.webp\" /></p>\n<p><small aria-hidden=\"true\">Illustration: Jonah Aragon / Privacy Guides | Photo: Jair L\u00e1zaro / Unsplash</small></p>\n<p>Biometrics are a convenient and secure way to authenticate our devices.

A secure and private biometric authentication system should store any biometric data fully on-device and further, shouldn't make it accessible at all, even to the user. Biometric data is so incredibly sensitive and uniquely identifying that it needs to be treated with the utmost care. For example, apps on your phone don't have direct access to your fingerprint or face data, they must use an <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/localauthentication\">API</a> to use biometric authentication.</p>\n<p>On the other end of the spectrum we have companies like <a href=\"https://www.idemia.com\">IDEMIA</a> which boast about their <a href=\"https://www.idemia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/augmented-vision-platform-idemia-brochure-202102.pdf\">Augmented Vision</a>, designed to take video data from the myriad surveillance cameras littering every US city and track you around everywhere you go. It combines facial recognition, object recognition, plate reading, and much more to create an Orwellian surveillance apparatus that stores all your data in some server somewhere, fully accessible to their customers (or any hackers that want a treasure trove of surveillance data). They also have a product called <a href=\"https://www.idemia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/mobile-biometric-check-idemia-brochure-202007.pdf\">Mobile Biometric Check</a> that allows cops to use their phone camera to take a picture of your fingerprints and compare them to a database. This is the exact opposite of responsible biometrics.</p>\n<h3 id=\"secure-element\"><span class=\"twemoji\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path d=\"M6 4h12v1h3v2h-3v2h3v2h-3v2h3v2h-3v2h3v2h-3v1H6v-1H3v-2h3v-2H3v-2h3v-2H3V9h3V7H3V5h3zm5 11v3h1v-3zm2 0v3h1v-3zm2 0v3h1v-3z\"/></svg></span> Secure Element</h3>\n<p>All forms of biometric authentication rely on proper hardware such as a secure element in order to be secure. The secure element provides a secure and tamper-resistant place to store your biometric data separate from the rest of the system, so it can't be easily extracted. Examples include Apple's <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/guide/security/secure-enclave-sec59b0b31ff/web\">Secure Enclave</a> and Google's <a href=\"https://security.googleblog.com/2021/10/pixel-6-setting-new-standard-for-mobile.html\">Titan M</a> series of chips. You should avoid devices that lack a secure element; they won't be able to properly implement secure biometrics without one.</p>\n<h3 id=\"final-thoughts\">Final thoughts</h3>\n<p>Like all technology, biometrics aren't inherently good or bad. They're used to secure our devices and make authentication smooth and easy, but they're also used for <a href=\"https://therecord.media/europe-gait-recognition-study-pilot-program\">mass surveillance</a>. Especially now with the rise of AI, we've started to leave the realm of scientifically rigorous usages and into the realm of digital snake oil, with companies like Cursor Insight launching their <a href=\"https://www.motionscore.ai\">MotionScore</a> product.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Our patent-pending AI technology identifies hidden patterns in signatures and online or mobile user interactions. These patterns can reflect behaviors and personal characteristics relevant to creditworthiness and reliability.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It should go without saying that making decisions about whom to give a loan to based on... how they sign their name or some other mystery movement data is ludicrous, laughable if it wasn't affecting real people's lives. Now more than ever we need to be educated about the biometric technology that we use and that's used against us. The <a href=\"https://sls.eff.org/technologies/biometric-surveillance\">EFF</a> is a great resource that documents and fights against abuses of biometric technology.</p>\n<p>Many of the same technologies used for mass surveillance are also used for <a href=\"https://www.amti.biz/2024/08/28/amti-technology-featured-in-triple-crown-power-5-fastpitch-tournament/\">helpful</a> purposes.

It seems almost all of them mention some level of privacy or encryption to entice the user to sign up for their service, but how can you be sure you\u2019re using the most secure, privacy respecting platform?<!-- more --></p>\n<p>The answer actually lies in one\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.privacyguides.org/basics/threat-modeling/\">threat model</a>, which is often an ignored step in choosing all privacy related apps and services, meaning a lot of users limit their internet and communication experience because they believe they need Edward Snowden level privacy settings.</p>\n<p>The truth is, each user needs to decide what their privacy goals are. Is your goal to stop corporations from tracking you, targeting you, and profiting from your data? Or, are you are trying to hide communications from the government or law enforcement, which is common for journalists and activists who want to protect their sources or communications from government eyes?</p>\n<p>Once you understand your goals you can start to look at messengers and their upsides and downsides, and it\u2019s important to remember, there is no perfect solution. Each service, no matter how secure can be compromised, because at the end of the day, you\u2019re dealing with other humans who can screenshot, copy, or forward your messages to parties you did not intend to see them. So, it\u2019s also important to know who you are messaging, verifying their keys, and ensuring that you place the utmost trust in them with the content you are sending.</p>\n<p>If your goal is to simply avoid corporate tracking and the harvesting of your data from your communications, you can eliminate apps such as Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp, both services owned by Facebook and while offering encrypted messaging (optional in Messenger), Facebook <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20210729190737/https://www.digitaltrends.com/social-media/facebook-reads-messenger-messages/\">reads your non-encrypted messages</a>, and WhatsApp has <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20210729190737/https://www.forbes.com/sites/zakdoffman/2019/05/14/whatsapps-cybersecurity-breach-phones-hit-with-israeli-spyware-over-voice-calls/#734cec155549\">fallen victim</a> to security breaches.</p>\n<p>For this type of user, your options are much more wide as you may be more willing to share your email address or phone number at signup and can be less concerned with metadata (we will get to that shortly), and you want to look for a messenger that simply isn\u2019t scanning your content or behavior to sell it.</p>\n<p>If your goal is to evade more massive state-sponsored surveillance programs, the aforementioned apps are out of the question, but so are many others.</p>\n<p>This is because when it comes to these apps, and other like it, you don\u2019t own the encryption keys, the service does, so they are able to decrypt your messages, for their own use, or for the use of government officials who request it. This is something important you\u2019ll want to remember as you choose the messenger that is right for you.</p>\n<p>Even Apple\u2019s iMessage, which is encrypted, while more secure than Facebook\u2019s offerings, still control the keys and can access your messages if necessary. Apple does also collect data based on your behavior, so while using iMessage isn\u2019t the same as handing your data over to Facebook, you\u2019re still messaging with a variety of privacy vulnerabilities. On Android, you\u2019re using <abbr title=\"Short Message Service (standard text messaging)\">SMS</abbr> messages which are even less secure and can be <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20210729190737/https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/18/16328172/sms-two-factor-authentication-hack-password-bitcoin\">easily hijacked</a> by someone with just enough know-how.</p>\n<h2 id=\"metadata\">Metadata</h2>\n<p>One important aspect of messaging apps you need to be sure of is what kind of <a href=\"https://ssd.eff.org/en/glossary/metadata\">metadata</a> it exposes, what is encrypted and what isn\u2019t.</p>\n<p>Wire, a popular encrypted messenger app has always been criticized for its decision not to encrypt user metadata, such as the date and time of registration, <abbr title=\"Internet Protocol\">IP</abbr> geographical coordinates, and the date and time of creation, creator, name, and list of participants in a conversation.</p>\n<p>Metadata can be used to place you in a certain location, speaking to a certain person and can be used against you by law enforcement, even if they have no idea and no access to what the conversation was about.</p>\n<p>Apps such as Signal, or Wickr encrypt metadata, making the conversations between two or more parties more secure and harder to track individual users with.</p>\n<p>When it comes to avoiding corporate data mining, your metadata won\u2019t be as useful, especially if you\u2019re using a service that is not profiting from your data to begin with. For those avoiding state-sponsored surveillance, <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20210729190737/https://theintercept.com/2019/08/04/whistleblowers-surveillance-fbi-trump/\">metadata can be a killer</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"encryption\">Encryption</h2>\n<p>This article will not get into the complexities of the best kinds of end-to-end encryption (<abbr title=\"End-to-End Encryption/Encrypted\">E2EE</abbr>), but ensuring your messenger has it, that must be discussed.</p>\n<p>The popular messaging app Telegram has come under fire the most for this. Telegram says on their homepage that, \u201cTelegram messages are heavily encrypted and can self-destruct.\u201d Yet, this statement is only partially true. Yes, you can set your messages to self-destruct, a great privacy feature for some, and yes, they do offer encryption, but what they don\u2019t tell users is that encryption isn\u2019t turned on by default.</p>\n<p>In an <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20210729190737/https://gizmodo.com/why-you-should-stop-using-telegram-right-now-1782557415\">interview</a> with Gizmodo, Christopher Soghoian, Principal Technologist and Senior Policy Analyst at the American Civil Liberties Union said that, \"There are many Telegram users who think they are communicating in an [end-to-end] encrypted way, when they\u2019re not because they don\u2019t realize that they have to turn on an additional setting,\" he continued to say that while he\u2019s happy they offer the encryption, it\u2019s not useful if it\u2019s turned off.</p>\n<p>Apps such as Signal, Keybase, and Wickr offer <abbr title=\"End-to-End Encryption/Encrypted\">E2EE</abbr> by default. Less popular but quickly growing apps such as Element, offer <abbr title=\"End-to-End Encryption/Encrypted\">E2EE</abbr> but like Telegram, have not made it a default setting, though the Matrix.org team has <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20210729190737/https://github.com/vector-im/element-web/issues/6779\">said</a> that default encryption is on their road map.</p>\n<p>Ensuring your conversations and metadata are <abbr title=\"End-to-End Encryption/Encrypted\">E2EE</abbr> is one of the best practices you can have when choosing a messenger.</p>\n<h2 id=\"registration-process\">Registration Process</h2>\n<p>When it comes to your goals and threat model, you will need to decide how much, if any, information you\u2019re willing to give this company on signup. Do they require a phone number and or <abbr title=\"Subscriber Identity Module\">SIM</abbr> card? Do they require an email address, or do they allow completely anonymous signups, and how anonymous is anonymous? Are they storing that info (remember the metadata) unencrypted?</p>\n<p>Giving up your phone number or email won\u2019t be a big deal for many, as any good privacy policy will state they won\u2019t use it for any purpose other than those you\u2019ve granted permission for. Yet, for those avoiding state-sponsored surveillance, you may have a regularly changing number, no number, or would rather not risk giving that information up. The same goes for email.</p>\n<p>So, you will want to find a service that fits this need. While Signal is currently testing signup without a phone number, currently you\u2019re unable to do so. Element, Wickr, many <abbr title=\"Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol\">XMPP</abbr> services, don\u2019t require anything but choosing a username.</p>\n<h2 id=\"source-code\">Source Code</h2>\n<p>Open source may be the most used phrase in all of privacy and security, and for good reason. It\u2019s really helpful to be able to review the source code of the product you\u2019re trusting. Experts can look for backdoors, leaks, and other bugs. Organizations that opt to open source their code are showing good faith effort to increase trust between them and the user.</p>\n<p>Yet, open source can also limit your options, again, depending on your threat model and goals. Signal, Wire, and Keybase all offer open source repositories of their applications, and sometimes even the server software itself.</p>\n<p>Open source also doesn\u2019t mean secure. This is often misunderstood, and people hear open source and assume it must be good. Look at the apps code you want to use, you don\u2019t need to be able to check it, but are others? An open source app that no one follows, or contributes to is no more or less secure than a closed source app.</p>\n<p>Wickr, Threema, and others are closed source. They don\u2019t offer the ability to check the source, but that doesn\u2019t immediately rule them out either. When the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) had a comparison chart for messenger apps, it gave Wickr 5-stars. This doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s perfect for someone like Snowden, but for those avoiding Facebook and Google, it could be a usable option.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s also important to remember there\u2019s no way to check that someone is always using the source code in their repository in the app or server you\u2019re downloading from the Apple Store or Google Play. When it comes to this, reputation becomes a key player in your decision, as does trust, which we will get to next.</p>\n<p>If you\u2019re unsure what to do here, it\u2019s always a safe bet to stick with open source that has a large contributor base and strong reputation. It\u2019s always best to use open source options when they are available and only recommend closed source when there isn\u2019t a usable open source option. This is generally a good way to pick a messenger app as well.</p>\n<h2 id=\"ownership-trust\">Ownership &amp; Trust</h2>\n<p>An often overlooked, but increasingly important part of choosing a secure messenger is, who owns the company that\u2019s providing your service? What would the gain or lose from selling your data, and who does the company answer to?</p>\n<p>Wire <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20210729190737/https://blog.privacytools.io/delisting-wire/\">recently lost</a> a great deal of trust and standing in the privacy world because they quietly sold their company and moved it to the US. They also changed parts of their privacy policy, making it harder for users to tell when Wire would share customer data. They did all of this while never updating their current users of such changes, either to the change of the privacy policy, or the move to the US.</p>\n<p>Wire also took in more than $8 million in venture capital funding. So now, users wanted to know more about who owned their data and what jurisdictional rights were changing with the move from Europe to the United States?</p>\n<p>These are questions we must ask of all services. Wire now has investors to answer to who will want a return on their millions of dollars.</p>\n<p>Signal on the other hand is a <a href=\"https://signal.org/blog/signal-foundation/\">non-profit</a> which does not rely on investors and instead relies on donations, sponsorships, and grants. Because of their non-profit status in the US, they must also be highly transparent about not only where the money comes from, but how they spend it. So, users can see where this money goes, and who it\u2019s going to.</p>\n<p>Matrix.org (the service Element uses) runs a similar business model as Signal, located in the UK instead of the US, they reply on donations, partnerships, and grants. Matrix.org is heavily supported by New Vector, a venture capital backed company, however, Matrix.org as a non-profit is transparent about its spending, income, and influences.</p>\n<p>Not all services are non-profit, and that should not rule them out immediately. You can also follow their funding goals. Wire lost credibility because instead of simply relying on user signups, they wanted to be the next Skype for Business and wanted to build a larger enough user base to get the attention of investors. Meanwhile, apps such as Wickr, while for-profit, is transparent about taking limited investors to become sustainable on subscriptions.</p>\n<p>This can take some time, because it\u2019s important to know who the investors are, and what the organizational goals are. Will they eventually need to resort to data harvesting to sustain itself, if they do, and you decide to leave the platform, will you leave behind data you don\u2019t want them to get their hands on?</p>\n<h2 id=\"making-your-choice\">Making Your Choice</h2>\n<p>Now it\u2019s time to choose a messenger and no one can do that for you. Popularity will need to play a role here, there\u2019s no point in joining the new up and coming messenger service if you don\u2019t have a single contact using it as well. One reason Telegram has been so popular is they have managed to convince more than 100 million people to sign up. If you sign in today, you\u2019ll likely see a group of your friends in there. Signal isn\u2019t as far behind, and others are catching up.</p>\n<p>You\u2019ll need to decide who you trust, and who your other contacts trust, and then compare all of that with your goals and your threat model. How much information are you willing to give on signup, does metadata matter to your threat model, and is the service you\u2019re choosing likely to sell itself to the highest bidder once enough people sign up?</p>\n<p>The important thing to remember is there is no one size fits all for messengers, and that each user must decide what is best for them. If someone is an avid WhatsApp or Facebook Messenger user, even Telegram is a step in the right direction. Yet, if that user is concerned with more than just giving data over to Facebook, they may need to look at more secure options.</p>\n<p>Ensure you keep your messenger apps up to date. You don\u2019t want to discover you\u2019ve been compromised because a bug found in version 1 was fixed in version 2, but you didn\u2019t bother upgrading your apps.</p>\n<p>One last piece of advice is that users need to be diligent and never become complacent in their decision. You must be willing to change services if the goals and values of your messenger of choice change in a way that no longer match yours.

Whether you trying to free up storage, limit tracking, or protect yourself from digital forensics, clearing browsing data is an important first step on your privacy journey. In this guide, we will explain how to clear your browsing data on five popular web browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Brave, and Edge.<!-- more --></p>\n<h2 id=\"understanding-browsing-data\">Understanding Browsing Data</h2>\n<p>Cookies are <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/privacy/what-are-cookies/\">small files that a website generates and sends to a browser</a>. They associate browsing activity to a given user session, allowing people to visit websites without logging in repeatedly. Cookies also facilitate <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbestechcouncil/2023/04/11/the-internet-of-you-how-web-personalization-is-shaping-the-future/\"><strong>personalization</strong></a>, where websites \"remember\" your preferences and actions. Websites utilize personalization cookies to send targeted advertisements and track your location.</p>\n<p>Website cache data <a href=\"https://learn.g2.com/what-is-cached-data\">refers to offline website data that your browser stores</a>. By preloading content like webpages and images, subsequent visits to a website becomes faster. Unlike cookies, a cache does not expire and must be manually cleared. If you are concerned about <a href=\"https://hawkeyeforensic.com/2024/03/30/browser-forensics-examining-browser-artifacts/\">digital forensics</a>, consider clearing it.</p>\n<p>Similarly, your browsing history must be deleted. As its name suggest, your web browser keeps a record of all visited websites offline. Your <a href=\"https://www.androidauthority.com/isp-tracking-1167088/\">internet service provider could still view your history</a>; however, you might want to prevent access from someone living with you.</p>\n<h2 id=\"clearing-browsing-data-on-google-chrome\">Clearing Browsing Data on Google Chrome</h2>\n<p>To start, <strong>launch</strong> Google Chrome. On the upper right-hand corner, click on the <strong>three-dots icon</strong> to see a list of options. Then, click on <strong>Settings</strong></p>\n<p><img alt=\"Screenshot: Google Home Page\" src=\"../../../../assets/images/clearing-your-browsing-data/chrome1.webp\" /></p>\n<p>You should see the following menu.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Screenshot: Google Chrome Settings\" src=\"../../../../assets/images/clearing-your-browsing-data/chrome2.webp\" /></p>\n<p>On the left, navigate to <strong>Privacy and Security</strong>. You should see the following screen.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Screenshot: Google Chrome Privacy and Security Settings\" src=\"../../../../assets/images/clearing-your-browsing-data/chrome3.webp\" /></p>\n<p>Click <strong>Delete browsing data.</strong> Here, you can check whether to clear your <strong>browsing history</strong>, <strong>cookies</strong>, and <strong>cached images &amp; files</strong>. Chrome also allows you select the <strong>time range</strong> of the data marked for deletion.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Screenshot: Google Chrome browser data options\" src=\"../../../../assets/images/clearing-your-browsing-data/chrome4.webp\" /></p>\n<p>After making any necessary changes, click <strong>Delete data</strong>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"clearing-browsing-data-on-firefox\">Clearing Browsing Data on Firefox</h2>\n<p>Start by launching <strong>Firefox</strong>. On the upper right-hand corner, click on the <strong>three-dot icon</strong> to see a list of options. There, click on <strong>Settings</strong>.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Screenshot: Firefox browser with Privacy Guides Homepage\" src=\"../../../../assets/images/clearing-your-browsing-data/firefox1.webp\" /></p>\n<p>On the left, navigate to <strong>Privacy and Security</strong>. You should see the following screen.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Screenshot: Firefox Settings\" src=\"../../../../assets/images/clearing-your-browsing-data/firefox2.webp\" /></p>\n<p>Scroll down to <strong>Cookies and Site Data</strong>.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Screenshot: Firefox Settings\" src=\"../../../../assets/images/clearing-your-browsing-data/firefox3.webp\" /></p>\n<p>You have the option of either clearing your browsing data within a time range or in selected websites. Note that the latter deletes the website's cookies and cache, not history.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Screenshot: Firefox Settings prompt displaying browser data\" src=\"../../../../assets/images/clearing-your-browsing-data/firefox5.webp\" /></p>\n<p>Click on <strong>Clear data</strong> if you prefer the former. Like Google Chrome, you can chose what types of data to delete and its time range. After making your selection, click <strong>Clear</strong> to finalize the process.</p>\n<h2 id=\"clearing-browsing-data-on-safari\">Clearing Browsing Data on Safari</h2>\n<p>Unlike Chrome and Firefox, Safari separates history settings from its privacy settings. For the purposes of this guide, we will delete browsing history first.</p>\n<p>After opening Safari, move your cursor to the upper left-hand corner. Click <strong>History</strong> once the title bar appears.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Screenshot: Safari with Privacy Guides Homepage\" src=\"../../../../assets/images/clearing-your-browsing-data/history1.webp\" /></p>\n<p>If you want to clear browsing history in a specified time range, select <strong>Clear History</strong> at the bottom and follow the prompt. Otherwise, click <strong>Show All History</strong>.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Screenshot: History Panel in Safari\" src=\"../../../../assets/images/clearing-your-browsing-data/history2.webp\" /></p>\n<p>In this menu, you can choose websites to delete from your history. Use the search bar to find the exact name of the website. You can also navigate to a specific data and time.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Screenshot: History Panel in Safari\" src=\"../../../../assets/images/clearing-your-browsing-data/history3.webp\" /></p>\n<p>Now, lets delete the cookies and cache data. Move your cursor to the title bar again and click <strong>Safari</strong> to see a drop down menu.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Screenshot: Safari title bar\" src=\"../../../../assets/images/clearing-your-browsing-data/safari.webp\" /></p>\n<p>Then, click <strong>Settings</strong> and then navigate to <strong>Privacy</strong>. You will see this screen.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Screenshot: Safari Privacy Settings\" src=\"../../../../assets/images/clearing-your-browsing-data/safariprivacy1.webp\" /></p>\n<p>Click <strong>Manage Website Data...</strong></p>\n<p><img alt=\"Screenshot: Prompt displaying website browser data\" src=\"../../../../assets/images/clearing-your-browsing-data/safariprivacy2.webp\" /></p>\n<p>Another menu will appear with a list of websites and their corresponding browsing data types. As always, you can mark specified websites for deletion. Once you are done, click <strong>Remove</strong>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"clearing-browsing-data-on-brave-browser\">Clearing Browsing Data on Brave Browser</h2>\n<p>As a Chromium-based browser, Brave is quite similar to Chrome. To start, <strong>launch</strong> Brave. On the upper right-hand corner, click on the <strong>three-bars icon</strong> to see a list of options. Then, click on <strong>Settings</strong></p>\n<p><img alt=\"Screenshot: Brave Home Page\" src=\"../../../../assets/images/clearing-your-browsing-data/brave2.webp\" /></p>\n<p>You should see the following menu.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Screenshot: Brave Settings\" src=\"../../../../assets/images/clearing-your-browsing-data/brave3.webp\" /></p>\n<p>On the left, select <strong>Privacy and Security</strong>. You should see the following screen.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Screenshot: Brave Privacy and Security Settings\" src=\"../../../../assets/images/clearing-your-browsing-data/brave4.webp\" /></p>\n<p>Click <strong>Delete browsing data.</strong> Here, you can check whether to clear your <strong>browsing history</strong>, <strong>cookies</strong>, and <strong>cached images &amp; files</strong>.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Screenshot: Brave browser data options\" src=\"../../../../assets/images/clearing-your-browsing-data/brave5.webp\" /></p>\n<p>Under <strong>Advanced</strong>, Brave also allows you select the <strong>time range</strong> of the data marked for deletion.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Screenshot: Brave Browser data options\" src=\"../../../../assets/images/clearing-your-browsing-data/brave6.webp\" /></p>\n<p>After making any necessary changes, click <strong>Delete data</strong>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"clearing-browsing-data-on-microsoft-edge\">Clearing Browsing Data on Microsoft Edge</h2>\n<p>Finally, we will finish this tutorial with Microsoft Edge. Start by launching the browser. On the upper right-hand corner, click on the <strong>three-dots icon</strong>. Next, click  <strong>Settings</strong>.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Screenshot: Edge Home Page\" src=\"../../../../assets/images/clearing-your-browsing-data/edge2.webp\" /></p>\n<p>In the settings page, navigate to <strong>Privacy, Search, and Services</strong></p>\n<p><img alt=\"Screenshot: Edge Settings\" src=\"../../../../assets/images/clearing-your-browsing-data/edge3.webp\" /></p>\n<p>Under <strong>Delete Browsing Data</strong>, click on <strong>Choose What to Clear</strong>.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Screenshot: Edge Settings \" src=\"../../../../assets/images/clearing-your-browsing-data/edge4.webp\" /></p>\n<p>Modify the time range and data to be deleted.

Because <a href=\"https://github.com/cryptpad\">CryptPad is open-source</a>, anyone can add contributions to it, inspect its code, or submit feature recommendations.</p>\n<p>There are many reasons that CryptPad is a great tool and a perfect replacement to Google Docs. Let's dig into its pros and cons, why you should use it, why you can trust it, and how you can keep it secure.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-makes-cryptpad-trustworthy\">What makes CryptPad trustworthy</h2>\n<p>Why trust CryptPad more than Google? First, the end-to-end encryption the CryptPad software utilizes uses <a href=\"#privacy-and-encryption\">strong and modern algorithms</a>. When encryption like this is well implemented, it means the content of your data can never be accessed by the CryptPad instance (server) operators. In contrast, services like Google hold the decryption keys to your data at all times, placing it at risk of being misused or compromised in a data breach. With CryptPad, if a CryptPad instance that has well implemented the software experienced a data breach and your encrypted content was stolen, your content would still be protected as long as you've used a unique, complex, and long password and protected it well.</p>\n<p>Second, because CryptPad's code is open, what it promises can be verified. Making source code open doesn't magically make it secure, but the CryptPad software is a project that had many eyes on in GitHub, has been around for over 10 years, and is actively maintained by a team experienced with open-source software.</p>\n<p>Additionally, if you decide to use CryptPad's flagship instance, your data will be hosted in France. This isn't magical either, but because European Union countries are all subjected to the <abbr title=\"General Data Protection Regulation\">GDPR</abbr> most have adopted stronger data privacy practices by default. While these other factors are not technical guarantees, they all serve to increase the level of trust we feel comfortable giving CryptPad's software and flagship instance.</p>\n<p>Finally, if you do not trust CryptPad at all, the good news is you don't have to. If you prefer to use an instance that is not run by the CryptPad team, you can look for <a href=\"https://cryptpad.org/instances/\">other organizations</a> hosting instances of CryptPad open to the public. Of course make sure to pick an instance worthy of your trust. If you decide you do not trust anyone else, you can <a href=\"https://github.com/cryptpad/cryptpad\">download the code for yourself</a> and create your own CryptPad instance only controlled by you.</p>\n<h2 id=\"starting-with-cryptpad\">Starting with CryptPad</h2>\n<p>Using CryptPad is very easy. CryptPad can be self-hosted if you prefer, but if this is not something you want to think about you can simply use CryptPad's <a href=\"https://cryptpad.fr/\">flagship instance</a> hosted in France. You can even start using it without an account. If you prefer to have an account to keep all your documents together you can create one for free, or you can have a look at CryptPad's <a href=\"https://cryptpad.org/pricing/\">paid plans</a> for users with greater needs.</p>\n<h3 id=\"without-an-account\">Without an account</h3>\n<p>Without an account, you can go to <a href=\"https://cryptpad.fr/\">https://cryptpad.fr/</a> and just click on a type of \"New document\" to start right away. Your username will be \"Guest\" and you will automatically be attributed a cute emoji for your Guest profile.</p>\n<p>You can create a new document, modify it, copy the URL link, then close the web page. To return to it, simply paste the same URL in a browser. To share this document, simply share the URL with someone else.</p>\n<div class=\"admonition warning\">\n<p class=\"admonition-title\">File security warning</p>\n<p>Anyone with the link will be able to see your file. Additionally, if this link includes \"Edit\" access, anyone with this link will be able to edit the file. Consider this when using this method.</p>\n</div>\n<p>Whether you create an account or not, the only information that could identify you when using CryptPad on a trustworthy instance is your <abbr title=\"Internet Protocol\">IP</abbr> address and your browser and device information. Depending on your threat model, to mitigate this you might want to use a trustworthy <a href=\"https://www.privacyguides.org/en/vpn/\"><abbr title=\"Virtual Private Network\">VPN</abbr> service</a> and/or the <a href=\"https://www.privacyguides.org/en/tor/\">Tor network</a>, coupled with a <a href=\"https://www.privacyguides.org/en/desktop-browsers/\">browser</a> hardened to reduce <a href=\"https://coveryourtracks.eff.org/\">fingerprinting</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"admonition tip\">\n<p class=\"admonition-title\">If you are at risk of targeted attacks</p>\n<p>If you would be at risk if your CryptPad usage was discovered later, and you do not want to leave any traces on your local computer that you have visited a CryptPad instance, you might want to use <a href=\"https://www.privacyguides.org/articles/2025/01/29/installing-and-using-tails/\">Tails</a>.</p>\n</div>\n<h3 id=\"creating-an-account\">Creating an account</h3>\n<p>You will see that <em>Privacy by Design</em> starts at the account creation level with CryptPad. You do not even have to provide an email address to start. All that you need to create an account is a cool username and a <a href=\"https://www.privacyguides.org/en/basics/passwords-overview/\">secure and unique password</a> (like all passwords should be).</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Screenshot from the CryptPad login page showing several application choices.\" src=\"../../../../assets/images/cryptpad-review/cryptpad-login.webp\" /></p>\n<p><small aria-hidden=\"true\">Unless credited otherwise, all screenshots from: Privacy Guides</small></p>\n<div class=\"admonition danger\">\n<p class=\"admonition-title\">Password security</p>\n<p>Make sure you note your unique, long, and complex password and username in a safe place. Due to the nature of end-to-end encryption, if you lose your username or password, there will be <strong>no account recovery possible</strong> and all your files will be lost.</p>\n</div>\n<h3 id=\"basic-security\">Basic security</h3>\n<p>Once you've created an account, the first thing you should do is secure it with a <a href=\"https://www.privacyguides.org/en/basics/multi-factor-authentication/\">second factor of authentication</a>. To do this, click on your username on the upper-right, then select \"Settings\" &gt; \"Security &amp; Privacy\" and follow the instructions for \"Two-Factor Authentication\".</p>\n<p>On the same \"Settings\" page, depending on your <a href=\"https://www.privacyguides.org/en/basics/threat-modeling/\">threat model</a>, you might also want to enable \"Safe Links\", disable \"Feedback\" (disabled by default), and disable \"Cache\". Disabling the cache can hinder performance though, so if your local device isn't at risk it may be unnecessary.</p>\n<h3 id=\"destroying-data\">Destroying data</h3>\n<p>Another option that CryptPad offers on the \"Settings\" page is a quick way to \"Destroy all owned documents\" at once. This can be a lifesaver feature for people at particularly high risk. Take good note of where this feature is in the menu.</p>\n<p>You can also delete files individually. To do this, once you have created a document you can click on the \"Access\" button on the top menu, and you will see an option to \"Destroy this document or folder permanently\". After you've clicked on \"Destroy\" once, you will see the button change to \"Are you sure?\" and you'll have to click it again to confirm. This is a well-designed safeguard because this action is irrevocable. Test it with an empty document just to see how it works first.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Screenshot from a CryptPad document page showing the &quot;destroy document&quot; option.\" src=\"../../../../assets/images/cryptpad-review/cryptpad-deletingfiles.webp\" /></p>\n<h3 id=\"backing-up-data\">Backing up data</h3>\n<p>There are several options to back up and export your data. From a document page, you can click on the \"File\" button on the upper-left, then select \"Export\". To back up all your documents at once, you can click on your username on the upper-right, then select \"Settings\" &gt; \"CryptDrive\" &gt; \"Backup\". This will create a zip file containing all your documents in plain text (unencrypted). Be careful where you store this file if it contains sensitive information.</p>\n<h3 id=\"additional-settings\">Additional settings</h3>\n<p>Another setting you should pay attention to is your Display name. You can change it in the \"Account\" section. This will be shown to your contacts in CryptPad if you add any.</p>\n<p>Additionally, you can change the theme to either Light or Dark in \"Appearance\", you can change the color associated with your account and file modifications in \"Cursor\", you can adjust the code editor indentation spaces in \"Code\", and you can make many other adjustments following your preferences.</p>\n<h2 id=\"cryptpads-instances-hosting\">CryptPad's instances &amp; hosting</h2>\n<p>The CryptPad team offers a flagship instance at <a href=\"https://cryptpad.fr/\">CryptPad.fr</a> that makes it easy to start using CryptPad quickly. Depending on your preference and circumstances, you might choose a different instance or even choose to host an instance yourself.</p>\n<h3 id=\"different-instances\">Different instances</h3>\n<p>For a list of third-party instances that have passed a series of checks from the CryptPad team to ensure they are up-to-date and use recommended settings, you can visit this page: <a href=\"https://cryptpad.org/instances/\">https://cryptpad.org/instances/</a></p>\n<div class=\"admonition warning\">\n<p class=\"admonition-title\">When using third-party instances</p>\n<p>Always consider your threat model when selecting an instance. Although the content of your files will be end-to-end encrypted, the instance's owner could have access to some metadata about you, such as your <abbr title=\"Internet Protocol\">IP</abbr> address or other activities. Additionally, an instance administrator could technically modify the CryptPad software they run to introduce malicious code. You should trust the instance you use as much as the code.</p>\n</div>\n<h3 id=\"self-hosting\">Self-hosting</h3>\n<p>To learn how to host your own CryptPad instance, you should consult <a href=\"https://docs.cryptpad.org/en/admin_guide/index.html#admin-guide\">CryptPad's documentation</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"user-experience\">User Experience</h2>\n<p>The user experience will likely feel pretty familiar to people who are already using Google Docs, Microsoft Office, OnlyOffice, or other similar office suites.</p>\n<h3 id=\"user-interface\">User interface</h3>\n<p>For document creation, CryptPad's user interface is rather straightforward. However, there are a few details in the interface that might be confusing at first. For example, clicking on your username (or Display name) on the upper-right will show an important dropdown menu, so you should remember to look there as it is not always obvious. This is the menu where you will find options for your \"Profile\", \"Calendar\", \"Contacts\", \"Settings\", \"Log out\", and more.</p>\n<p>Once inside a document, click on the \"File\" button on the upper-left to see the file's \"History\", \"Export\", or \"Print\" features, and more.</p>\n<p>To destroy a document, you will need to click on the \"Access\" button at the top of a document page.</p>\n<h3 id=\"export-and-import-documents\">Export and import documents</h3>\n<p>You can export or import documents to CryptPad in HTML format, but keep in mind there might be some formatting issues with certain document types.</p>\n<h2 id=\"document-options\">Document Options</h2>\n<p>Each time you create a new document, no matter which type, you will have the following options: to make it an \"Owned document\", which means having full control over it (you need to be the owner of a document to delete it); to pick a \"Destruction date\", to <strong>make the document self-destroy</strong> after a certain number of months, days, or even hours; and to \"<strong>Add a password\"</strong> to password-lock the document.</p>\n<h3 id=\"self-destruction\">Self-destruction</h3>\n<p>For any sensitive document, it's a great idea to enable the auto-destruction feature, even if it's far in the future. This adds a layer of security in case you lose your password, forget about an important file that shouldn't be lingering around, or for any other sensitive situations.</p>\n<h3 id=\"password-lock\">Password lock</h3>\n<p>Because sharing the link to a document without a password makes it accessible to anyone with this link, you should add a password to any sensitive document and share this password on a secure channel only. Make sure you select a password that is different from your account password and is also unique from other passwords you use. Ideally, always prefer a <em>passphrase</em>.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Screenshot from a CryptPad document creation popup showing the option to add a password.\" src=\"../../../../assets/images/cryptpad-review/cryptpad-creatingfile.webp\" /></p>\n<h3 id=\"access-control\">Access control</h3>\n<p>For any document you can control how it is accessed by clicking on the \"Access\" button at the top. There, you can change the document's password, delete the document, see the list of accesses and ownership.</p>\n<p>When you share a document by clicking on the \"Share\" button at the top, you can select different types of access rights, such as \"View\", \"Edit\", and \"View once and self-destruct\". The latter can be a particularly useful feature for people in highly sensitive situations.</p>\n<h2 id=\"applications-available\">Applications Available</h2>\n<p>CryptPad offers a wide variety of applications, or document types, making CryptPad a complete office suite. To create a new file from your <em>CryptDrive</em> page, click on the large \"+ New\" button. You will see a popup menu where you can select: \"Folder\", \"Shared folder\", Upload files\", \"Upload folder\", \"New Link\", \"Sheet\", \"Document\", \"Presentation\", \"Rich text\", \"Kanban\", \"Code\", \"Form\", \"Whiteboard\", \"Markdown slides\", and \"Diagram\".</p>\n<p>That's a lot of choice!</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Screenshot from the CryptPad new document popup showing all the types of document that can be created.\" src=\"../../../../assets/images/cryptpad-review/cryptpad-filetypes.webp\" /></p>\n<div class=\"admonition success\">\n<p class=\"admonition-title\">New from this week!</p>\n<p><mark><em>Document</em> and <em>Presentation</em> applications have just been unlocked to all users on CryptPad.fr this week!</mark></p>\n<p>This is fantastic for collaborative work because the new <em>Document</em> type allows tracking changes within a document. These two new types of document are still in testing phase however, so make sure to back up your data regularly. Improvements will likely be added slowly in the coming weeks, until the final release planned for the end of March 2025.</p>\n</div>\n<p>Here are screenshots of each application included in CryptPad to give you a better idea of what possibilities are in there:</p>\n<h3 id=\"sheet\">Sheet</h3>\n<p>The usual classic spreadsheet for all your calculation needs. If you are familiar with Google Docs' spreadsheet, you will likely find this one easy to use:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Screenshot from a CryptPad spreadsheet document.\" src=\"../../../../assets/images/cryptpad-review/cryptpad-sheet.webp\" /></p>\n<h3 id=\"document\">Document</h3>\n<p>The classic text document with advanced formatting features:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Screenshot from a CryptPad doc-type document.\" src=\"../../../../assets/images/cryptpad-review/cryptpad-document.webp\" /></p>\n<h4 id=\"tracking-changes\">Tracking changes</h4>\n<p>If you want to enable change tracking in this application, click on the \"Collaboration\" tab, then click on the \"Track Changes\" button, and select your preferred tracking option:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Screenshot from a CryptPad doc-type document showing the menu option to track changes.\" src=\"../../../../assets/images/cryptpad-review/cryptpad-trackingchanges.webp\" /></p>\n<h3 id=\"presentation\">Presentation</h3>\n<p>Another classic application to help you create slideshows:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Screenshot from a CryptPad presentation document.\" src=\"../../../../assets/images/cryptpad-review/cryptpad-presentation.webp\" /></p>\n<h3 id=\"rich-text\">Rich text</h3>\n<p>A basic text document type for simpler text files:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Screenshot from a CryptPad rich text document.\" src=\"../../../../assets/images/cryptpad-review/cryptpad-richtext.webp\" /></p>\n<h3 id=\"kanban\">Kanban</h3>\n<p>A useful kanban organization tool to plan your projects:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Screenshot from a CryptPad kanban document.\" src=\"../../../../assets/images/cryptpad-review/cryptpad-kanban.webp\" /></p>\n<h3 id=\"code\">Code</h3>\n<p>A light code editor with previewing feature. This is especially useful for HTML files:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Screenshot from a CryptPad code document.\" src=\"../../../../assets/images/cryptpad-review/cryptpad-code.webp\" /></p>\n<h3 id=\"form\">Form</h3>\n<p>A form tool to create and share surveys, without sharing your survey data with unwanted third-parties:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Screenshot from a CryptPad form document.\" src=\"../../../../assets/images/cryptpad-review/cryptpad-form.webp\" /></p>\n<h3 id=\"whiteboard\">Whiteboard</h3>\n<p>A fun whiteboard tool if you feel creative, need to draw to explain, need to write and collaborate on complex math equations, and much more:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Screenshot from a CryptPad whiteboard document.\" src=\"../../../../assets/images/cryptpad-review/cryptpad-whiteboard.webp\" /></p>\n<h3 id=\"markdown-slides\">Markdown slides</h3>\n<p>A simple application to quickly create and preview slides in Markdown format:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Screenshot from a CryptPad markdown slide document.\" src=\"../../../../assets/images/cryptpad-review/cryptpad-markdown.webp\" /></p>\n<h3 id=\"diagram\">Diagram</h3>\n<p>A flexible tool to create diagrams, for all your visual explanatory needs:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Screenshot from a CryptPad diagram document.\" src=\"../../../../assets/images/cryptpad-review/cryptpad-diagram.webp\" /></p>\n<h3 id=\"calendar\">Calendar</h3>\n<p>And finally, this isn't a document type per se, but you might be happy to hear CryptPad also integrates a Calendar application. This can be a fantastic tool to organize with your team and events. You can access it by clicking on your username on the upper-right, then selecting \"Calendar\":</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Screenshot from the CryptPad calendar application.\" src=\"../../../../assets/images/cryptpad-review/cryptpad-calendar.webp\" /></p>\n<h2 id=\"privacy-and-encryption\">Privacy and Encryption</h2>\n<p>Everything in CryptPad is designed to minimize data collection. It's also designed to minimize the data visible to the instance's operators as much as feasible. This is great for privacy and significantly improves data security. If the data isn't accessible to even the instance's operators, then it also isn't accessible to thieves or abusive authorities.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-encryption-does-cryptpad-use\">What encryption does CryptPad use?</h3>\n<p>With CryptPad, all your data is encrypted on your device before it is sent to the remote server. You never have to worry about data being readable in-transit or at-rest on the server. Only authorized users, senders and intended recipients, can access the decrypted data.</p>\n<p>To lock your account, CryptPad creates cryptographic keys derived from your username and password together. This means CryptPad servers never even see your username or password. In fact, a normal CryptPad server cannot even know if you are using the software with an account or not. Additionally, this makes it so that multiple people could use the same username, as long as they register with a different password.</p>\n<p>To secure documents, CryptPad uses <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric-key_algorithm\">symmetric encryption</a> with a <a href=\"https://blog.cryptpad.org/2024/03/14/Most-Secure-CryptPad-Usage/\">secret key unique to each document</a>. This ensures your document is unreadable to anyone who doesn't have the corresponding key.</p>\n<p>Keep in mind however than when you share a link to a document, this link contains the symmetric key to encrypt and decrypt the document, and to verify and issue the signatures. This access is irrevocable. Which means that if you want to stop someone who received the link to a document from accessing it later on, you will need to make a copy of this document and destroy the original you have shared.</p>\n<h3 id=\"your-public-key\">Your public key</h3>\n<p>If you want to access your own CryptPad public key, you can click on your username on the upper-right, then select \"Profile\" and click on \"View my profile\". There you can click on \"Copy public key\" and this will copy your key to your device's clipboard.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Screenshot from a CryptPad profile page showing the copy public key button.\" src=\"../../../../assets/images/cryptpad-review/cryptpad-profile.webp\" /></p>\n<h3 id=\"encryption-algorithms\">Encryption algorithms</h3>\n<p>CryptPad uses a variety of reputable algorithms for its encryption needs. Here's a summary of what type of encryption CryptPad implements:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>For login authentication: The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrypt\">scrypt</a> key derivation function (KDF).</li>\n<li>For symmetric encryption: The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salsa20\">XSalsa20</a>-<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poly1305\">Poly1305</a> algorithms.</li>\n<li>For public-key encryption: The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve25519\">x25519</a>-<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salsa20\">XSalsa20</a>-<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poly1305\">Poly1305</a> algorithms.</li>\n<li>For signatures: The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EdDSA#Ed25519\">Ed25519</a> signature scheme.</li>\n<li>For hashes: The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2\">SHA-512</a> algorithm.</li>\n<li>For all other cryptographic operations: The <a href=\"https://tweetnacl.js.org/#/\">TweetNaCl.js</a> library.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can read more details about how CryptPad implements encryption in <a href=\"https://blog.cryptpad.org/2023/02/02/Whitepaper/\">CryptPad's white paper</a>.</p>\n<p>You can read more on a comparison of cryptography libraries CryptPad uses in <a href=\"https://blueprints.cryptpad.org/review/libraries/\">CryptPad's Blueprints</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"post-quantum-encryption\">Post-quantum encryption</h3>\n<p>Like many other applications using encryption, CryptPad is preparing for the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-quantum_cryptography\">post-quantum age</a> evaluating how quantum-resistant its current algorithms are, and following closely recommendations for standards improvement.</p>\n<p>This is all very new as the <a href=\"https://www.nist.gov/\">National Institute of Standards and Technology</a> (NIST) just selected newly proposed post-quantum resistant algorithms <a href=\"https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2024/08/nist-releases-first-3-finalized-post-quantum-encryption-standards\">last summer</a> to establish new encryption standards and recommendations.</p>\n<p>Preparing now to harden encryption standards against future quantum computers possibly capable of breaking currently used cryptographic algorithms is very important. The CryptPad development team is already preparing for this and <a href=\"https://blueprints.cryptpad.org/review/agility/\">plans to transition</a> towards NIST's post-quantum new standards.</p>\n<h3 id=\"perfect-forward-secrecy\">Perfect forward secrecy</h3>\n<p>CryptPad's team is also <a href=\"https://xwiki.com/en/Blog/CryptPad-overview-2024/\">planning</a> on implementing <a href=\"https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/perfect-forward-secrecy/\">perfect forward secrecy</a> for its next generation. This will be a great improvement to secure communication within CryptPad, because it makes each session key unique. This means that if a session key was to be compromised, this would not affect any other sessions, significantly reducing the scope and damage of an attack.</p>\n<h3 id=\"keeping-cryptpad-secure\">Keeping CryptPad secure</h3>\n<p>Like any privacy-focused product, CryptPad isn't magical. While CryptPad offers some of the very best protections for your privacy, you still have to take certain measures to secure your CryptPad data properly. CryptPad cannot control this part.</p>\n<p>Here's a few things you should remember to keep your CryptPad data secure and private:</p>\n<p><strong>Trustworthy server:</strong> It's important to select a CryptPad instance that is trustworthy. Keep in mind that the instance operators could have access to your <abbr title=\"Internet Protocol\">IP</abbr> address or could theoretically maliciously modify the CryptPad's code they use to make it insecure.</p>\n<p><strong>Safe device:</strong> Your device also needs to be safe and secure. There isn't much that <em>any</em> external service can do to protect your data if your device is compromised.</p>\n<p><strong><abbr title=\"Internet Protocol\">IP</abbr> address:</strong> Don't forget that whenever you connect to a server, website, or any service online, you are sharing your <abbr title=\"Internet Protocol\">IP</abbr> address, which can be used to identify and locate you, more or less accurately. If this is a threat to you, consider using a trustworthy <abbr title=\"Virtual Private Network\">VPN</abbr> or the Tor network to protect your <abbr title=\"Internet Protocol\">IP</abbr> address.</p>\n<p><strong><abbr title=\"Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure\">HTTPS</abbr>:</strong> Make sure the CryptPad instance's address you use starts with \"<abbr title=\"Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure\">HTTPS</abbr>\".</p>\n<p><strong>Document links:</strong> Because CryptPad includes the keys to decrypt your document in the links you use and share, anyone who can access your browsing history could potentially read your decrypted document. This is also true for anything in your browser or device that can access your browser's history (extensions, synced accounts, screen-sharing, Windows Recall, etc.). To mitigate this, you should <a href=\"https://docs.cryptpad.org/en/user_guide/user_account.html#security-privacy\">enable</a> the option \"Safe links\" in \"Settings\" &gt; \"Security &amp; Privacy\".</p>\n<p><strong>Password:</strong> It's important to safeguard your password properly and <em>choose a password that is unique, complex, and long</em>. No matter how good the encryption is, if someone guesses your password, it's game over.</p>\n<p><strong>Multifactor authentication:</strong> As soon as you create an account, you should enable a second factor of authentication. This will help protect your data against account takeover, in case your password were to be guessed or leaked. This is true for any account you have.</p>\n<p><strong>Document accesses:</strong> Be careful to reduce the document's access to the minimum access required for functionality. For example, if you share a document link publicly, make sure it's a read-only link that doesn't allow anyone to edit it.</p>\n<p><strong>File history:</strong> By default, files keep history of document changes and who viewed or modified a document. You can see this in \"File\" &gt; \"History\". If you need to erase this history for safety but keep the document, you can go to \"File\" &gt; \"Make a copy\", then go back to the original document with the history you need to erase, click on \"Access\", then \"Destroy\", then click again on \"Are you sure?\". This will permanently destroy your original document. Be careful, there is no recovery after this.</p>\n<p><strong>Static keys:</strong> CryptPad uses static keys to encrypt your documents. This means that once you have shared a document, and therefore its static keys, you cannot revoke this access. By default, anyone you have shared a link to your document with will retain this access indefinitely. If you wish to revoke access, you can make a copy of the document then destroy the original. This will also erase the document's history.</p>\n<p>To learn more about the CryptPad team's recommendations on the most secure way to use CryptPad, you can read <a href=\"https://blog.cryptpad.org/2024/03/14/Most-Secure-CryptPad-Usage/\">this article</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"downsides\">Downsides</h2>\n<p>There are a few downsides in using CryptPad as your office suite.</p>\n<p>First, due to the nature of end-to-end encryption, it is slower. Naturally, each file needing to get decrypted before each use can slow down your workflow. The CryptPad instance you have chosen to use, your internet connection's speed, and your device's speed are all factors that can contribute in making this operation slower or faster. But remember, you are trading speed for security and privacy.</p>\n<p>Second, there is no mobile or desktop app available at this time. CryptPad only runs in the browser (for now). Depending on your type of usage, this can be inconvenient. Additionally, this means there is no way to access your data locally unless you create a copy of it in plain text on your device. Other end-to-end document applications such as <a href=\"https://standardnotes.com/\">Standard Notes</a> or <a href=\"https://anytype.io/\">Anytype</a> allow users to access documents offline, but they do not offer collaborative and office suite features like CryptPad does.</p>\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Finally, if you are looking for a replacement to Google Docs, switching to CryptPad is an obvious choice.</p>\n<p>With solid end-to-end encryption for all your document content and minimal data collection at all steps of the registration process, CryptPad is an excellent option for your data privacy <em>and</em> your data security.</p>\n<p>If data privacy is important to you, <strong>there is no reason to keep your sensitive information in the Google ecosystem</strong>, especially with everything that we know about it now.</p>\n<p>Switching to CryptPad, you will benefit from the same type of applications (and more), still be able to share links with external parties without requiring them to create an account, and store information remotely in a secure way.</p>\n<p>But <em>in addition</em> to Google Docs, you will benefit from strong end-to-end encryption on everything you wish to keep private, true document destruction for everything that you want gone, and a complete office suite that only you and your team can access, away from intrusive Google scans or even CryptPad's knowledge.</p>\n<p>If you need a remote collaborative office suite that is secure and respects your privacy, there is no reason not to switch to CryptPad.</p>\n<h2 id=\"support-cryptpad\">Support CryptPad</h2>\n<p>If you wish to support this free and open-source project, you can help CryptPad by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://fosstodon.org/@cryptpad\">Following CryptPad on Mastodon</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://opencollective.com/cryptpad/contribute/\">Donating on Open Collective</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/cryptpad\">Contributing on GitHub</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://peertube.xwiki.com/c/cryptpad_channel/videos\">Watching CryptPad's videos on PeerTube</a></li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p><em><strong>Editor's Note (Feb. 12):</strong> This article was updated to clarify the difference between CryptPad (the open source software) and instances of CryptPad like CryptPad.fr (the hosted cloud instance of CryptPad operated by CryptPad's creators) in certain contexts.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Share this page:</strong><br />\n<a class=\"md-button\" href=\"https://x.com/intent/tweet?text=CryptPad%20Review%3A%20Replacing%20Google%20Docs&amp;url=https%3A//murateren.github.io/mynotes/blog/2025/05/01/cryptpad-review/&amp;hashtags=&amp;via=erenm\" style=\"margin-right: 1em;\">Share on <span class=\"twemoji\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path d=\"M18.901 1.153h3.68l-8.04 9.19L24 22.846h-7.406l-5.8-7.584-6.638 7.584H.474l8.6-9.83L0 1.154h7.594l5.243 6.932ZM17.61 20.644h2.039L6.486 3.24H4.298Z\"/></svg></span></a>\n<a class=\"md-button\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&amp;url=https%3A//murateren.github.io/mynotes/blog/2025/05/01/cryptpad-review/&amp;title=CryptPad%20Review%3A%20Replacing%20Google%20Docs&amp;summary=If%20you%20have%20been%20looking%20for%20a%20privacy-respectful%20replacement%20to%20Google%20Docs%2C%20now%20is%20the%20time%20to%20switch%20to%20the%20end-to-end%20encrypted%20office%20suite%20CryptPad.\">Share on <span class=\"twemoji\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path d=\"M19 3a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H5a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V5a2 2 0 0 1 2-2zm-.5 15.5v-5.3a3.26 3.26 0 0 0-3.26-3.26c-.85 0-1.84.52-2.32 1.3v-1.11h-2.79v8.37h2.79v-4.93c0-.77.62-1.4 1.39-1.4a1.4 1.4 0 0 1 1.4 1.4v4.93zM6.88 8.56a1.68 1.68 0 0 0 1.68-1.68c0-.93-.75-1.69-1.68-1.69a1.69 1.69 0 0 0-1.69 1.69c0 .93.76 1.68 1.69 1.68m1.39 9.94v-8.37H5.5v8.37z\"/></svg></span></a></p>", "image": "https://murateren.github.io/mynotes//assets/images/social/cryptpad-review.png", "date_published": "2025-05-01T10:30:00+00:00", "authors": [{"name": "Murat Eren"}], "tags": ["Reviews"]}, {"id": "https://murateren.github.io/mynotes/blog/2025/05/01/encryption-is-not-a-crime/", "url": "https://murateren.github.io/mynotes/blog/2025/05/01/encryption-is-not-a-crime/", "title": "Encryption Is Not a Crime", "content_html": "<p><img alt=\"Photo of a red key on an all black background.\" src=\"../../../../assets/images/encryption-is-not-a-crime/encryption-is-not-a-crime-cover.webp\" /></p>\n<p><small aria-hidden=\"true\">Photo: Matt Artz / Unsplash</small></p>\n<p>Contrary to what some policymakers seem to believe, whether naively or maliciously, encryption is not a crime.

It is the lock on your digital door preventing harmful intruders from entering your home. Encryption is also the door itself, protecting your privacy and intimacy from creepy eavesdroppers while you go about your life.</p>\n<p>It's not a crime to lock your home's door for protection, <strong>why would it be a crime to lock your digital door?</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"../privacy-means-safety/\">Encryption protects you</a> from cyberattack, identity theft, discrimination, doxxing, stalking, sexual violence, physical harm, and much more.</p>\n<h2 id=\"who-says-encryption-is-a-crime\">Who says encryption is a crime</h2>\n<p>Anyone who is well-informed will find it hard to believe someone could want to sabotage such fantastic protection.</p>\n<p>Yet, <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/1993/02/crypto-rebels/\">year</a> after <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/a-new-era-of-attacks-on-encryption-is-starting-to-heat-up/\">year</a>, oppressive regimes and lazy or greedy <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/computing/cyber-security/anonymity-is-not-a-fundamental-right-experts-disagree-with-europol-chiefs-request-for-encryption-back-door\">law enforcement</a> entities around the world have attempted to <a href=\"https://www.howtogeek.com/544727/what-is-an-encryption-backdoor/\">undermine encryption</a> using the pretext this is needed to \"solve crime\", despite all the experts <em>repeatedly</em> warning on how <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/08/post-snowden-tech-became-more-secure-but-is-govt-really-at-risk-of-going-dark/\">unnecessary</a> and <a href=\"https://www.globalencryption.org/2020/11/breaking-encryption-myths/\">dangerous</a> this would be. And this is without accounting for all the countries where encryption is <em>already</em> <a href=\"https://www.gp-digital.org/world-map-of-encryption/\">severely restricted</a>, such as Russia, China, India, Iran, Egypt, Cuba, and others.</p>\n<p>Whether breaking encryption is brought up naively by misinformed authorities, or as a disguised excuse for mass surveillance is up for debate.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, the result is the same: An attempt to destroy <strong>a tool we all need to stay safe</strong>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"encryption-is-a-protective-shield\">Encryption is a protective shield</h2>\n<p>Encryption, moreover end-to-end encryption, is a tool we all use in our digital life to stay safe.</p>\n<p>In today's world, the boundary between online and offline life is largely dissolved. Almost everything we do \"offline\" has a record of it \"online\". Online life is regular life now. It's not just your browsing history.</p>\n<p>Your medical record from a visit at the clinic, your purchase transaction from a trip to the store, your travel photos saved in the cloud, your text conversations with your friends, family, and children, are all likely protected with encryption, perhaps even with <em>end-to-end</em> encryption.</p>\n<p>Such a large trove of personal data needs to be protected against eavesdropping and malicious attacks for everyone to stay safe.</p>\n<p>Encryption offers this protection. End-to-end encryption all the more.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-is-end-to-end-encryption-and-what-is-the-war-against-it\">What is end-to-end encryption, and what is the war against it</h2>\n<p>End-to-end encryption is a type of encryption where only the intended recipient(s) have the ability to decrypt (read) the encrypted data.</p>\n<p>This means that if you send a message through <a href=\"https://signal.org/\">Signal</a> for example, only the participants to this conversation will be able to read the content of this conversation. Even Signal cannot know what is being discussed on Signal.</p>\n<p>This greatly annoys some over-controlling authorities who would like to be granted unlimited power to spy on anyone anytime they wish, for vaguely defined purposes that could change at any moment.</p>\n<p>End-to-end encryption can also mean a situation where you are \"both ends\" of the communication.</p>\n<p>For example, when enabling Apple's <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-ca/guide/security/sec973254c5f/web\">Advanced Data Protection for iCloud</a> (ADP), it activates end-to-end encryption protection for almost all of iCloud data, including photos. This means that even Apple could not see your photos, or be forced to share your photos with a governmental entity.</p>\n<p>Without ADP, Apple can read or share your photos (or other data) if they are legally compelled to, or if they feel like it. The same is true for Google's services, Microsoft's services, and any other online services that aren't end-to-end encrypted.</p>\n<p>This is at the root of the latest attack on encryption:</p>\n<p>In February this year, it was reported that <a href=\"../uk-forced-apple-to-remove-adp/\">Apple was served with a notice</a> from the UK's Home Office to force it to break ADP's end-to-end encryption. In response, Apple removed access to ADP from the UK entirely, making this protection unavailable to UK residents.</p>\n<p>Do not mistakenly think this attack is limited to the UK and Apple users, however. If this regulation notice or a similar one gets enforced, it would <strong>impact the whole world.</strong> Other countries would likely soon follow, and other services would likely soon get under attack as well.</p>\n<p>Moreover, do not feel unaffected just because you use end-to-end encryption with <a href=\"https://www-svt-se.translate.goog/nyheter/inrikes/signal-lamnar-sverige-om-regeringens-forslag-pa-datalagring-klubbas?_x_tr_sl=auto&amp;_x_tr_tl=en&amp;_x_tr_hl=en-US&amp;_x_tr_pto=wapp\">Signal</a> or <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/vpn/vpn-privacy-security/secure-encryption-and-online-anonymity-are-now-at-risk-in-switzerland-heres-what-you-need-to-know\">Proton</a> services instead of Apple, they are both <strong>under attack</strong> as well in this war.</p>\n<p>Just in recent years, the war against encryption has affected the <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2023/04/earn-it-bill-back-again-seeking-scan-our-messages-and-photos\">US</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cgj54eq4vejo\">UK</a>, <a href=\"https://www.globalencryption.org/2025/04/joint-letter-on-swedish-data-storage-and-access-to-electronic-information-legislation/\">Sweden</a>, <a href=\"https://www.laquadrature.net/en/warondrugslaw/\">France</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/12/21513212/backdoor-encryption-access-us-canada-australia-new-zealand-uk-india-japan\">Australia, New Zealand, Canada, India, Japan</a>, and all the European Union countries with proposals such as <a href=\"../the-future-of-privacy/#chat-control-wants-to-break-end-to-end-encryption\">Chat Control</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-arguments-given-to-break-encryption-make-no-sense\">The arguments given to break encryption make no sense</h2>\n<p>Authoritarian entities generally use the same populist excuses to justify their senseless demands. \"Protecting the children\" is always a fashionable disingenuous argument.</p>\n<p>Because no one would disagree that protecting the children is important, it is often used as an attempt to deceitfully make an irrefutable argument to justify breaking encryption.</p>\n<p>The problem is, <strong>breaking encryption doesn't protect the children</strong>, it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/jan/21/end-to-end-encryption-protects-children-says-uk-information-watchdog\">endangers</a> them.</p>\n<p>When law enforcement officials claim they need to be able to read everyone's messages and see everyone's personal photos to be able to fight child predators, they seem to neglect that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>This means they will expose the children's messages, contact information, locations, and photos in the process, potentially <em>endangering the children further</em>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Exposing everyone's data will make this data much more likely to be found and exploited by criminals, making <em>everyone</em> more vulnerable to attacks.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Predators will simply move to underground channels, <a href=\"https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2015/07/back_doors_wont.html\">unbothered</a>.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>They use the same kind of deceptive argument trying to justify weakening the protections we have to supposedly catch \"criminals\" and \"terrorists\".</p>\n<p>Of course the exact definition of what is a \"criminal\" or a \"terrorist\" is always vague and subject to change. In the past, human rights activists and authoritarian regime dissidents have been labeled as such, climate change activists as well, LGBTQ+ people even in some countries. Maybe next year this label will include \"DEI advocates\", who knows where they draw the line and what can be considered a \"criminal\" worth spying on.</p>\n<p>You <em>cannot</em> remove everyone's right to privacy and protection from harm while pretending it is to protect them. No one who is well-informed and well-intended could possibly consider this a smart thing to do.</p>\n<p><strong>An attack on end-to-end encryption isn't an attack on criminals, it's an attack on all of us.</strong></p>\n<h2 id=\"magical-backdoor-only-for-the-good-guys-is-a-complete-fantasy\">Magical backdoor only for \"the good guys\" is a complete fantasy</h2>\n<p>Let's say the strategy is akin to creating a MagicalKey that unlocks every door (a magical key because thinking encryption backdoors would only be used by \"the good guys\" is a great example of <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/science/magical-thinking\">magical thinking</a>).</p>\n<p>Imagine, for the sake of this exercise, the MagicalLock for this MagicalKey is impossible to pick, and imagine only police officers have MagicalKeys. Let's say one thousand police officers each have a MagicalKey.</p>\n<p>They argue they need to be able to unlock anyone's door if they suspect a crime is happening inside. \"It's for safety!\"</p>\n<p>Overtime, let's say only 1% of the police officers accidentally lose their MagicalKey. This kind of things happen. Now 10 MagicalKeys are lost in the wild and could be used by anyone else, for any purposes, including crime.</p>\n<p>Then, let's say only 0.1% of police officers get corrupted by a crime gang. That's just one right? This corrupted \"good guy\" lets the gang create a double of the MagicalKey. Which crime gang wouldn't want a key that can magically open any door? They pay the police officer good money for this. It's an investment.</p>\n<p>Now, the gang creates doubles of the MagicalKey they have. They obfuscate its serial number, so it cannot be traced back to them. They use it subtly at first to avoid detection. They make sure they never leave traces behind, so victims have no idea their door got unlocked.</p>\n<p>During this time, they steal your data, they sell it, they use it to impersonate you, they use it to harm you and your loved ones.</p>\n<p>Then, another criminal figures out on their own how to emulate a MagicalKey without even having access to one. The criminal creates a reproducible mold for this Emulated-MagicalKey and sells it to other criminals on the criminal market. Now, the MagicalKey\u2122\ufe0f is available to any criminals looking for it. Restrictions on the backdoor are off. <strong>Your personal data is up for grabs.</strong></p>\n<p>This is what is going to happen if backdoors are implemented in end-to-end encryption. But don't worry they say, \"it's only for the good guys!\".</p>\n<p>At least, the criminals' data will also be up for grabs, right?</p>\n<p>Nope! The criminals knew about this, so they just started using different channels that weren't impacted. Criminals will have their privacy intact, they don't care about using illegal tools, but <strong>your legal privacy protections will be gone</strong>.</p>\n<p><em>Backdoored</em> end-to-end encryption isn't end-to-end anymore, it's just open-ended encryption. This offers pretty much no protection at all.</p>\n<h2 id=\"ignoring-experts-doesnt-make-facts-disappear\">Ignoring experts doesn't make facts disappear</h2>\n<p>Where is the opposition to this? Where are the experts pushing against this nightmare? Everywhere.</p>\n<p>Thankfully, opposition has been strong, despite the relentless ignorance or malevolence from authoritarian authorities repeatedly pushing against encryption.</p>\n<p>Many people and groups have been fighting valiantly to defend our collective right to privacy and security. Countless experts have patiently taken the time to explain <a href=\"https://signal.org/blog/uk-online-safety-bill/\">again</a> and <a href=\"https://www.globalencryption.org/2020/10/cdt-gpd-and-internet-society-reject-time-worn-argument-for-encryption-backdoors/\">again</a> and <a href=\"https://www.schneier.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/paper-keys-under-doormats-CSAIL.pdf\">again</a> how an encryption backdoor only for \"the good guys\" is simply impossible.</p>\n<p>Weakening encryption to let \"the good guys\" enter, lets <em>anyone</em> enter, including criminals. There is no way around this.</p>\n<p>Seemingly ignoring warnings and advice from the most respected specialists in the field, authoritarian officials continue to push against encryption. So much so that it has become difficult to assume good intent misguided by ignorance at this point.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, ignoring the experts or silencing the debate will not make the facts magically disappear.</p>\n<p>In an encouraging development this week, Apple <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cvgn1lz3v4no\">won a case</a> fighting an attempt from the UK Home Office to hide from the public details of their latest attack on encryption.</p>\n<p>This battle and all battles to protect our privacy rights, <em>must</em> be fought is broad daylight, for all to see and to support.</p>\n<h2 id=\"fight-for-encryption-rights-everywhere-you-can\">Fight for encryption rights everywhere you can</h2>\n<p>The war against encryption isn't anything new, it has been happening for decades.

This was then further tightened with <a href=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2021/08/10/firefox-91-introduces-enhanced-cookie-clearing/\">Enhanced Cookie Clearing</a>. We\u2019re also looking very forward to <a href=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2021/05/18/introducing-site-isolation-in-firefox/\">Site Isolation</a> (code named Fission) being enabled by default in the coming releases.<!-- more --></p>\n<p>Now that so many privacy features are built into the browser, there is little need for extensions made by third-party developers. Accordingly, we have updated our very outdated <a href=\"https://www.privacyguides.org/desktop-browsers/\">browser</a> section. If you\u2019ve got an old browser profile we suggest <strong>creating a new one</strong>. Some of the old advice may make your browser <em>more</em> unique.</p>\n<h2 id=\"privacy-tweaks-aboutconfig\">Privacy Tweaks \u201cabout:config\u201d</h2>\n<p>We\u2019re no longer recommending that users set <code>about:config</code> switches manually. Those switches need to be up-to-date and continuously maintained. They should be studied before blindly making modifications. Sometimes their behavior changes in between Firefox releases, is superseded by other keys, or gets removed entirely. We do not see any point in duplicating the efforts of the community <a href=\"https://github.com/arkenfox/user.js\">Arkenfox</a> project. Arkenfox has very good documentation in their <a href=\"https://github.com/arkenfox/user.js/wiki\">wiki</a>, and we use it ourselves.</p>\n<h2 id=\"localcdn-and-decentraleyes\">LocalCDN and Decentraleyes</h2>\n<p>These extensions aren\u2019t required with Total Cookie Protection (<abbr title=\"Transmission Control Protocol\">TCP</abbr>), which is enabled if you\u2019ve set Enhanced Tracking Protection (ETP) to <strong>Strict</strong>.</p>\n<p>Replacing scripts on CDNs with local versions is not a comprehensive solution and is a form of <a href=\"https://www.ranum.com/security/computer_security/editorials/dumb/\">enumeration of badness</a>. While it may work with some scripts that are included it doesn\u2019t help with most other third-party connections.</p>\n<p>CDN extensions never really improved privacy as far as sharing your <abbr title=\"Internet Protocol\">IP</abbr> address was concerned and their usage is fingerprintable as this Tor Project developer <a href=\"https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/applications/tor-browser/-/issues/22089#note_2639603\">points out</a>. They are the wrong tool for the job and are not a substitute for a good <abbr title=\"Virtual Private Network\">VPN</abbr> or Tor. Its worth noting the <a href=\"https://git.synz.io/Synzvato/decentraleyes/-/tree/master/resources\">resources</a> for Decentraleyes are hugely out of date and would not be likely used anyway.</p>\n<h2 id=\"neaturls-and-clearurls\">NeatURLs and ClearURLs</h2>\n<p>Previously we recommended ClearURLs to remove tracking parameters from URLs you might visit. These extensions are no longer needed with uBlock Origin\u2019s <a href=\"https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Static-filter-syntax#removeparam\"><code>removeparam</code></a> feature.</p>\n<h2 id=\"https-everywhere\"><abbr title=\"Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure\">HTTPS</abbr> Everywhere</h2>\n<p>The EFF announced back in September they were <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/09/https-actually-everywhere\">deprecating <abbr title=\"Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure\">HTTPS</abbr>-Everywhere</a> as most browsers now have an <abbr title=\"Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure\">HTTPS</abbr>-Only feature. We are pleased to see privacy features built into the browser and Firefox 91 introduced <a href=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2021/08/10/firefox-91-introduces-https-by-default-in-private-browsing/\"><abbr title=\"Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure\">HTTPS</abbr> by Default in Private Browsing</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"multi-account-containers-and-temporary-containers\">Multi Account Containers and Temporary Containers</h2>\n<p>Container extensions aren\u2019t as important as they used to be for privacy now that we have <a href=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2021/02/23/total-cookie-protection/\">Total Cookie Protection</a>.</p>\n<p>Multi Account Container will still have some use if you use <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla_VPN\">Mozilla <abbr title=\"Virtual Private Network\">VPN</abbr></a> as it is going to be <a href=\"https://github.com/mozilla/multi-account-containers/issues/2210\">integrated</a> allowing you to configure specified containers to use a particular <abbr title=\"Virtual Private Network\">VPN</abbr> server. Another use might be if you want to log in to multiple accounts on the same domain.</p>\n<h2 id=\"just-in-time-compilation-jit\">Just-In-Time Compilation (JIT)</h2>\n<p>What is \u201cDisable JIT\u201d in Bromite? This option disables the JavaScript performance feature <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-in-time_compilation\">JIT</a>. It can increase security but at the cost of performance. Those trade-offs vary wildly and are explored in <a href=\"https://microsoftedge.github.io/edgevr/posts/Super-Duper-Secure-Mode/\">this</a> publication by Johnathan Norman from the Microsoft Edge team. This option is very much a security vs performance option.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mozilla-browsers-on-android\">Mozilla browsers on Android</h2>\n<p>We don\u2019t recommend any Mozilla based browsers on Android. This is because we don\u2019t feel that <a href=\"https://mozilla.github.io/geckoview\">GeckoView</a> is quite as secure as it could be as it doesn\u2019t support <a href=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/2021/05/introducing-firefox-new-site-isolation-security-architecture\">site isolation</a>, soon to be coming in desktop browsers or <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1565196\">isolated processes</a>.</p>\n<p>We also noticed that there isn\u2019t an option for <a href=\"https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/fenix/issues/16952#issuecomment-907960218\"><abbr title=\"Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure\">HTTPS</abbr>-Only mode</a>. The only way to get something similar is to install the <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/09/https-actually-everywhere\">deprecated</a> extension <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere\"><abbr title=\"Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure\">HTTPS</abbr> Everywhere</a>.</p>\n<p>There are places which Firefox on Android shines for example browsing news websites where you may want to <em>partially</em> load some JavaScript (but not all) using medium or hard <a href=\"https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Blocking-mode\">blocking mode</a>. The <a href=\"https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/view-articles-reader-view-firefox-android\">reader view</a> is also pretty cool. We expect things will change in the future, so we\u2019re keeping a close eye on this.</p>\n<h2 id=\"fingerprinting\">Fingerprinting</h2>\n<p>Firefox has the ability to block known third party <a href=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2020/01/07/firefox-72-fingerprinting/\">fingerprinting resources</a>. Mozilla has <a href=\"https://support.mozilla.org/kb/firefox-protection-against-fingerprinting\">advanced protection</a> against fingerprinting (RFP is enabled with Arkenfox).</p>\n<p>We do not recommend extensions that promise to change your <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/browser-fingerprinting-introduction-and-challenges-ahead/\">browser fingerprint</a>. Some of those extensions <a href=\"https://www.cse.chalmers.se/~andrei/codaspy17.pdf\">are detectable</a> by websites through JavaScript and <a href=\"https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-03152176/file/style-fingerprinting-usenix.pdf\">CSS</a> methods, particularly those which inject anything into the web content.</p>\n<p>This includes <strong>all</strong> extensions that try to change the user agent or other browser behavior to prevent fingerprinting. We see these often recommended on Reddit and would like to say that they will likely make you more unique and can be circumvented. Arkenfox has <a href=\"https://github.com/arkenfox/user.js/wiki/4.1-Extensions\">a good list</a> of extensions you could use, and a list of ones you <a href=\"https://github.com/arkenfox/user.js/wiki/4.1-Extensions#-dont-bother\">needn't bother with</a>. We also like to say testing sites which show you how unique you are in a set of users are often using hugely tainted results that are not indicative of real-world usage.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><em>Special thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/Thorin-Oakenpants\">Thorin-Oakenpants</a> and <a href=\"https://tommytran.io\">Tommy</a> for their help with providing advice and further documentation during the research phase.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Share this page:</strong><br />\n<a class=\"md-button\" href=\"https://x.com/intent/tweet?text=Blog%20Post%20Title%20Placeholder&amp;url=https%3A//murateren.github.io/mynotes/blog/2025/05/01/firefox-privacy-2021-update/&amp;hashtags=Browsers%2CFirefox&amp;via=erenm\" style=\"margin-right: 1em;\">Share on <span class=\"twemoji\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path d=\"M18.901 1.153h3.68l-8.04 9.19L24 22.846h-7.406l-5.8-7.584-6.638 7.584H.474l8.6-9.83L0 1.154h7.594l5.243 6.932ZM17.61 20.644h2.039L6.486 3.24H4.298Z\"/></svg></span></a>\n<a class=\"md-button\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&amp;url=https%3A//murateren.github.io/mynotes/blog/2025/05/01/firefox-privacy-2021-update/&amp;title=Blog%20Post%20Title%20Placeholder&amp;summary=Blog%20Post%20Description%20Placeholder\">Share on <span class=\"twemoji\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path d=\"M19 3a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H5a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V5a2 2 0 0 1 2-2zm-.5 15.5v-5.3a3.26 3.26 0 0 0-3.26-3.26c-.85 0-1.84.52-2.32 1.3v-1.11h-2.79v8.37h2.79v-4.93c0-.77.62-1.4 1.39-1.4a1.4 1.4 0 0 1 1.4 1.4v4.93zM6.88 8.56a1.68 1.68 0 0 0 1.68-1.68c0-.93-.75-1.69-1.68-1.69a1.69 1.69 0 0 0-1.69 1.69c0 .93.76 1.68 1.69 1.68m1.39 9.94v-8.37H5.5v8.37z\"/></svg></span></a></p>", "image": "https://murateren.github.io/mynotes//assets/images/social/firefox-privacy-2021-update.png", "date_published": "2025-05-01T10:30:00+00:00", "authors": [{"name": "Murat Eren"}], "tags": ["Browsers", "Firefox", "Reviews"]}, {"id": "https://murateren.github.io/mynotes/blog/2025/05/01/firefox-privacy/", "url": "https://murateren.github.io/mynotes/blog/2025/05/01/firefox-privacy/", "title": "Blog Post Title Placeholder", "content_html": "<h1 id=\"firefox-privacy-tips-and-tricks-for-better-browsing\">Firefox Privacy: Tips and Tricks for Better Browsing</h1>\n<p><img alt=\"&quot;Firefox Privacy&quot; cover image\" src=\"../../../../assets/images/firefox-privacy/cover.webp\" /></p>\n<p><small aria-hidden=\"true\">Illustration: Jonah Aragon / Privacy Guides | Photo: Unsplash</small></p>\n<p>Mozilla Firefox is one of the most popular web browsers around, and for good reason. It's fast, secure, open-source, and it's backed by an organization that actually respects your privacy. Unlike many other Chrome alternatives and forks, it has a massive development team behind it that publishes new updates on a constant, regular basis. Regular updates don't only mean shiny new features, it means you'll also receive security updates that will keep you protected as you browse the web.<!-- more --></p>\n<p>Because of all of this, <a href=\"https://www.privacyguides.org/desktop-browsers/#firefox\">we recommend Firefox</a> as our general-purpose browser for most users. It's the best alternative to Chrome and Edge for privacy conscious individuals.</p>\n<p>Firefox is fantastic out of the box, but where it really shines is customizability. By adjusting Firefox privacy settings and using helpful add-ons, you can increase your privacy and security even further. Making those changes is what we're going to go over in this Firefox privacy guide.</p>\n<p>Before we get started, there's a couple of things that should be noted that are not only applicable to this guide, but privacy in general:</p>\n<h2 id=\"considerations\">Considerations</h2>\n<p>Protecting your privacy online is a tricky proposition, there are so many factors to take into consideration on an individual basis for any one guide or site to cover comprehensively. You will need to take into account things like threat modeling and your general preferences before making any changes or following any recommendations.</p>\n<h3 id=\"threat-modeling\">Threat Modeling</h3>\n<p>What is <a href=\"https://www.privacyguides.org/basics/threat-modeling/\">threat modeling</a>? Consider who you're trying to keep your data hidden from. Do you need to keep your information hidden from the government, or just the average stranger? Maybe you are just looking to alternatives to Big Tech like Google and Facebook. You'll also want to consider how much time and resources you want to spend hiding your data from those \"threats\". Some solutions might not be feasible from a financial or time standpoint, and you'll have to make compromises. Taking all those questions into account creates a basic threat model for you to work with.</p>\n<p>We want to publish a more complete guide on threat modeling in the future, so stay tuned to this blog for further updates. But for now, just keep those thoughts in the back of your mind as we go through this article. Not every solution might be for you, or conversely you may need to pay more attention to certain areas we aren't able to cover completely.</p>\n<h3 id=\"browser-fingerprinting\">Browser Fingerprinting</h3>\n<p>Another consideration is your browser's fingerprint. When you visit a web page, your browser voluntarily sends information about its configuration, such as available fonts, browser type, and add-ons. If this combination of information is unique, it may be possible to identify and track you without using more common tracking tools, like cookies.</p>\n<p>That's right, add-ons contribute to your fingerprint. Another thing a lot of people miss when they are setting up their browser is that more is not always the best solution to their problems. You don't need to use every add-on and tweak we recommend installed, and the more you configure, the greater chance there is that your browser will appear more unique to websites. Think about your specific situation and pick and choose the add-ons and tweaks we recommend only if you think they will help you.</p>\n<h2 id=\"firefox-privacy-settings\">Firefox Privacy Settings</h2>\n<p>We'll start off with the easy solutions. Firefox has a number of privacy settings built in, no add-ons necessary! Open your Options page (Preferences on macOS) and we'll go through them one at a time.</p>\n<h3 id=\"dns-over-https\"><abbr title=\"Domain Name System\">DNS</abbr> over <abbr title=\"Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure\">HTTPS</abbr></h3>\n<p><abbr title=\"Domain Name System\">DNS</abbr> (or the Domain Name System) is what your browser uses to turn domain names like <code>privacyguides.org</code> into <abbr title=\"Internet Protocol\">IP</abbr> addresses like <code>65.109.20.157</code>. Because computers can only make connections to <abbr title=\"Internet Protocol\">IP</abbr> addresses, it's necessary to use <abbr title=\"Domain Name System\">DNS</abbr> every time you visit a new domain. But <abbr title=\"Domain Name System\">DNS</abbr> is unencrypted by default, that means everyone on your network (including your <abbr title=\"Internet Service Provider\">ISP</abbr>) can view what domains you're looking up, and in some situations even change the <abbr title=\"Internet Protocol\">IP</abbr> answers to redirect you to their own websites! Encrypting your <abbr title=\"Domain Name System\">DNS</abbr> traffic can shield your queries and add some additional protection to your browsing.</p>\n<p>Encrypted <abbr title=\"Domain Name System\">DNS</abbr> takes many forms: <abbr title=\"Domain Name System\">DNS</abbr> over <abbr title=\"Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure\">HTTPS</abbr> (<abbr title=\"DNS over HTTPS\">DoH</abbr>), <abbr title=\"Domain Name System\">DNS</abbr> over <abbr title=\"Transport Layer Security\">TLS</abbr>, DNSCrypt, etc., but they all accomplish the same thing. They keep your <abbr title=\"Domain Name System\">DNS</abbr> queries private from your <abbr title=\"Internet Service Provider\">ISP</abbr>, and they make sure they aren't tampered with in transit between your <abbr title=\"Domain Name System\">DNS</abbr> provider. Fortunately, Firefox recently added native <abbr title=\"DNS over HTTPS\">DoH</abbr> support to the browser. On the <strong>General</strong> page of your preferences, scroll down to and open <strong>Network Settings</strong>. At the bottom of the window you will be able to select \"Enable <abbr title=\"Domain Name System\">DNS</abbr> over <abbr title=\"Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure\">HTTPS</abbr>\" and choose a provider.</p>\n<p>Keep in mind that by using <abbr title=\"DNS over HTTPS\">DoH</abbr> you're sending all your queries to a single provider, probably Cloudflare unless you choose <a href=\"https://www.privacyguides.org/dns/\">another provider</a> that supports <abbr title=\"Domain Name System\">DNS</abbr> over <abbr title=\"Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure\">HTTPS</abbr>. While it may add some privacy protection from your <abbr title=\"Internet Service Provider\">ISP</abbr>, you're only shifting that trust to the <abbr title=\"DNS over HTTPS\">DoH</abbr> provider. Make sure that's something you want to do.</p>\n<p>It should also be noted that even with <abbr title=\"DNS over HTTPS\">DoH</abbr>, your <abbr title=\"Internet Service Provider\">ISP</abbr> will still be able to see what domain you're connecting to because of a technology called Server Name Indication (<abbr title=\"Server Name Indication\">SNI</abbr>). Until <abbr title=\"Server Name Indication\">SNI</abbr> is encrypted as well, there's no getting around it. Encrypted <abbr title=\"Server Name Indication\">SNI</abbr> (eSNI) is in the works \u2014 and can actually be <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/encrypt-that-sni-firefox-edition/\">enabled on Firefox</a> today \u2014 but it only works with a few servers, mainly ones operated by Cloudflare, so its use is limited currently. Therefore, while <abbr title=\"DNS over HTTPS\">DoH</abbr> provides some additional privacy and integrity protections, its use as a privacy tool is limited until other supplemental tools like eSNI and <a href=\"https://www.icann.org/resources/pages/dnssec-what-is-it-why-important-2019-03-05-en\"><abbr title=\"Domain Name System Security Extensions\">DNSSEC</abbr></a> are finalized and implemented.</p>\n<h3 id=\"change-your-search-engine\">Change Your Search Engine</h3>\n<p>This is an easy one. In the <strong>Search</strong> tab, change your <strong>Default Search Engine</strong> to something other than Google. Out of the built-in options, DuckDuckGo is the most privacy respecting service, but there's a number of <a href=\"https://www.privacyguides.org/search-engines/\">search engines we would recommend</a> that can be easily installed as well.</p>\n<h3 id=\"enhanced-tracking-protection\">Enhanced Tracking Protection</h3>\n<p>Now we'll delve into the biggest set of options for people like us, Firefox's <strong>Privacy &amp; Security</strong> tab. First up is their <strong>Enhanced Tracking Protection</strong>. This set of filters is set to Standard by default, but we'll want to change it to Strict for more comprehensive coverage.</p>\n<p>In rare occasions, Strict browsing protections might cause some of the websites you visit to not function properly. But there's no need to worry! If you suspect the Strict browsing protection is breaking a website you visit frequently, you can disable it on a site by site basis with the shield icon in the address bar.</p>\n<p>Disabling Enhanced Tracking Protection will of course decrease your privacy on that site, so you will have to consider whether that's something you are willing to compromise on, on a site-by-site basis.</p>\n<p>Another benefit of Firefox's Enhanced Tracking Protection is that it can actually speed up your browsing! Advertising networks and social media embeds can sometimes make your browser download huge files just to show an ad or a like button, and blocking those out trims the fat, in a sense.</p>\n<h3 id=\"disabling-telemetry\">Disabling Telemetry</h3>\n<p>When you use Firefox, Mozilla collects information about what you do, what kind of extensions you have installed, and various other aspects of your browser. While they claim to do this in a privacy-respecting way, sending as little data as possible is always preferred from a privacy standpoint, so we would go ahead and uncheck all the boxes under <strong>Firefox Data Collection and Use</strong> just to be safe.</p>\n<h3 id=\"clearing-cookies-and-site-data\">Clearing Cookies and Site Data</h3>\n<p>This one is for more advanced users, so if you don't understand what this is doing you can skip this section. Firefox provides the option to delete all your cookies and site data every time Firefox is closed. Cookies and site data are little pieces of information sites store in your browser, and they have a myriad of uses. They are used for things like keeping you logged in and saving your website preferences, but they also can be used to track you across different websites. By deleting your cookies regularly, your browser will appear clean to websites, making you harder to track.</p>\n<p>This will likely log you out of websites quite often, so make sure that's an inconvenience you're willing to put up with for enhanced privacy.</p>\n<h2 id=\"firefox-privacy-add-ons\">Firefox Privacy Add-ons</h2>\n<p>Of course, just the browser settings alone won't go quite far enough to protect your privacy. Mozilla has made a lot of compromises in order to provide a more functional browsing experience for the average user, which is completely understandable. But, we can take it even further with some browser add-ons that prevent tracking and make your experience more private and secure.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.privacyguides.org/desktop-browsers/#ublock-origin\">We recommend a number of fantastic add-ons</a> for Firefox, nine at the time of writing, but they aren't all necessary for everyone. Some of them provide redundant functionality to each other, and some of them accomplish similar tasks to the settings we've enabled above.</p>\n<p>When you are installing add-ons for Firefox, consider whether you actually need them for your personal browsing. Remember that fingerprinting warning from earlier? Adding as many extensions as possible might make you stand out more, which is not the goal.</p>\n<p>Keeping all that in mind, there are three add-ons I would consider necessary for virtually every user:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>uBlock Origin</li>\n<li><abbr title=\"Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure\">HTTPS</abbr> Everywhere</li>\n<li>Decentraleyes</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Out of the box, these add-ons only complement the settings we've described in this article already, and they have sane defaults that won't break the sites you visit.</p>\n<h3 id=\"ublock-origin\">uBlock Origin</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/\"><strong>uBlock Origin</strong></a> is an efficient ad- and tracker-blocker that is easy on memory, and yet can load and enforce thousands more filters than competing blockers. We trust it because it is completely open-source. Additionally, unlike its competitors it has no monetization strategy: There's no \"Acceptable\" ads program or a similar whitelist like many other ad blockers feature.</p>\n<h3 id=\"https-everywhere\"><abbr title=\"Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure\">HTTPS</abbr> Everywhere</h3>\n<p><abbr title=\"Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure\">HTTPS</abbr> is the secure, encrypted version of <abbr title=\"Hypertext Transfer Protocol\">HTTP</abbr>. When you see an address starting with <code>https://</code> along with the padlock in your browser's address bar, you know that your connection to the website is completely secure. This is of course important when you're logging into websites and sending your passwords and emails in a form. But it also prevents people on your network and your <abbr title=\"Internet Service Provider\">ISP</abbr> from snooping in on what you're reading, or changing the contents of an unencrypted webpage to whatever they want.</p>\n<p>Therefore, <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere\"><strong><abbr title=\"Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure\">HTTPS</abbr> Everywhere</strong></a> is a must-have extension, all it does is upgrade your <abbr title=\"Hypertext Transfer Protocol\">HTTP</abbr> connections to <abbr title=\"Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure\">HTTPS</abbr> wherever possible. And because it works silently in the background, you probably will never notice it! We trust <abbr title=\"Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure\">HTTPS</abbr> Everywhere because it is completely open-source, and is developed by the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a non-profit dedicated to private and secure technologies.</p>\n<p>Of course, it only works with sites that support <abbr title=\"Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure\">HTTPS</abbr> on the server's side, so you'll still need to keep an eye on your address bar to make sure you're securely connected. But fortunately more and more websites have implemented <abbr title=\"Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure\">HTTPS</abbr> thanks to the advent of free certificates from organizations like Let's Encrypt.</p>\n<h3 id=\"decentraleyes\">Decentraleyes</h3>\n<p>When you connect to many websites, your browser is most likely making connections to a myriad of \"Content Delivery Networks\" like Google Fonts, Akamai, and Cloudflare, to download fonts and JavaScript that make the website run. This generally makes websites look and feel better, but it means you're constantly making connections to these servers, allowing them to build a fairly accurate tracking profile of you.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/decentraleyes\"><strong>Decentraleyes</strong></a> works by impersonating those CDNs locally in your browser. When a website wants to download a program like jQuery, instead of connecting to a remote CDN Decentraleyes will serve the file from its own cache of files. This means that you'll won't have to make remote CDN connections for the files that Decentraleyes supports, and therefore the remote CDNs can't track your browser. Because everything is stored locally instead of on a far away server, Decentraleyes has the added benefit of speeding up your browsing as well. Everything happens instantly, and you won't see a difference in the websites you visit.</p>\n<h3 id=\"additional-privacy-add-ons\">Additional Privacy Add-ons</h3>\n<p>There is of course more functionality that can be achieved at the expense of more time spent configuring your browser and reduced website functionality. If you're looking for the most privacy options possible however, they may be for you. Check out our <a href=\"https://www.privacyguides.org/desktop-browsers/\">desktop browsers recommendations page</a> for further information and additional resources.</p>\n<h2 id=\"more-privacy-functionality\">More Privacy Functionality</h2>\n<p>Firefox has developed a number of other privacy tools that can be used to enhance your privacy or security. They may be worth looking into, but they have some drawbacks that would prevent me from recommending them outright.</p>\n<h3 id=\"firefox-private-network\">Firefox Private Network</h3>\n<p>Firefox Private Network is a new extension developed by Mozilla that serves as a <a href=\"https://www.privacyguides.org/basics/vpn-overview/\">Virtual Private Network</a> (<abbr title=\"Virtual Private Network\">VPN</abbr>), securing you on public Wi-Fi networks and other situations where you might trust Mozilla more than the <abbr title=\"Internet Service Provider\">ISP</abbr> or network administrator. It is free in beta, but will likely be available at some subscription pricing once the test pilot ends.</p>\n<p>Firefox Private Network is still just a <abbr title=\"Virtual Private Network\">VPN</abbr>, and there are a number of drawbacks you would want to consider before using it. We wrote an entire article on <a href=\"https://www.jonaharagon.com/posts/choosing-a-vpn/\">choosing a <abbr title=\"Virtual Private Network\">VPN</abbr> provider</a> that is worth a read, but it boils down to the fact that your <abbr title=\"Virtual Private Network\">VPN</abbr> provider will be able to see your web traffic. All you are accomplishing is shifting the trust from your network to the <abbr title=\"Virtual Private Network\">VPN</abbr> provider, in this case <em>Cloudflare</em>, the operators behind this service.</p>\n<p>Additionally, unlike a traditional <abbr title=\"Virtual Private Network\">VPN</abbr>, only data through the Firefox browser is protected, not every app on your machine.

There are a number of concerns with entrusting internet traffic to the US and other fourteen eyes countries that should not be overlooked.</p>\n<p>If you require a Virtual Private Network, we would look elsewhere.

For example, you could have Facebook in a container separate from your other browsing. In this situation, Facebook would only be able to set cookies with your profile on sites within the container, keeping your other browsing protected.</p>\n<p>A containers setup may be a good alternative to techniques like regularly deleting cookies, but requires a lot of manual intervention to set up and maintain. If you want complete control of what websites can do in your browser, it's definitely worth looking into, but we wouldn't call it a necessary addition by any means.</p>\n<h2 id=\"additional-resources\">Additional Resources</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.privacyguides.org/desktop-browsers/\">Desktop Browsers (Privacy Guides)</a> \u2014 Our comprehensive set of recommendations for browsers and tweaks you can make to enhance your privacy is a great next step for more advanced users looking to protect their privacy online.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/arkenfox/user.js\">Arkenfox user.js</a> \u2014 For more advanced users, the Arkenfox user.js is a \"configuration file that can control hundreds of Firefox settings [...] which aims to provide as much privacy and enhanced security as possible, and to reduce tracking and fingerprinting as much as possible - while minimizing any loss of functionality and breakage\".</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/privacy/\">Mozilla's Privacy Policy</a> \u2014 Of course, we always recommend reading through the privacy statement of any organization you deal with, and Mozilla is no exception.</p>\n<h2 id=\"firefox-privacy-summary\">Firefox Privacy Summary</h2>\n<p>In conclusion, we believe that Firefox is the most promising browser for privacy-conscious individuals.

Below are some of the reasons why we recommend GrapheneOS over CalyxOS.<!-- more --></p>\n<h2 id=\"update-frequency\">Update Frequency</h2>\n<p>CalyxOS has a track record of being slower to apply security and feature updates to its <abbr title=\"Operating System\">OS</abbr> and core applications than other custom Android operating systems. Timely security updates are one of the most important factors to consider when determining whether an <abbr title=\"Operating System\">OS</abbr> is secure enough for regular use, which is a requirement for privacy.</p>\n<p>In contrast to that, GrapheneOS manages to stay close to upstream and in some cases even <a href=\"https://grapheneos.org/features#more-complete-patching\">deliver updates before the stock <abbr title=\"Operating System\">OS</abbr> does</a>.</p>\n<p>As an example, <a href=\"https://grapheneos.org/releases#2021102020\">GrapheneOS's first Android 12 release</a> was in October 2021, whereas <a href=\"https://calyxos.org/news/2022/01/19/android-12-changelog/\">CalyxOS moved to Android 12</a> in January 2022.</p>\n<h2 id=\"sandboxed-google-play-vs-privileged-microg\">Sandboxed Google Play vs Privileged microG</h2>\n<p>When Google Play Services are used on GrapheneOS, they are confined using the highly restrictive, default <a href=\"https://source.android.com/security/selinux/concepts\"><code>untrusted_app</code></a> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security-Enhanced_Linux\"><abbr title=\"Security-Enhanced Linux\">SELinux</abbr></a> domain. As a result, you have full control as to what these apps can access via permissions, just like any other app you install. Additionally, you can selectively choose which profile(s) to install the Sandboxed Google Play in.</p>\n<p>microG is a partially open-source re-implementation of Google Play Services.<sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"#fn:1\">1</a></sup> On CalyxOS, it runs in the highly privileged <a href=\"https://source.android.com/security/selinux/concepts\"><code>system_app</code></a> <abbr title=\"Security-Enhanced Linux\">SELinux</abbr> domain like regular Google Play Services, and it uses <a href=\"https://github.com/microg/GmsCore/wiki/Signature-Spoofing\">signature spoofing</a> to masquerade as Google Play Services. This is less secure than Sandboxed Google Play's approach, which does not need access to sensitive system APIs.</p>\n<p>When using Sandboxed Google Play, you have the option to reroute location requests to the Play Services API back to the <abbr title=\"Operating System\">OS</abbr> location API, which uses satellite based location services. With microG, you have the option to choose between different backend location providers, including <em>shifting trust</em> to another location backend, like Mozilla; using <a href=\"https://github.com/n76/DejaVu\">DejaVu</a>, a location backend that locally collects and saves RF-based location data to an offline database which can be used when <abbr title=\"Global Positioning System\">GPS</abbr> is not available; or to simply not use a network location backend at all.</p>\n<p>Network location providers like Play Services or Mozilla rely the on the <abbr title=\"Media Access Control\">MAC</abbr> addresses of surrounding Wi-Fi access points and Bluetooth devices being submitted for location approximation. Choosing a network location like Mozilla to use with microG provides little to no privacy benefit over Google because you are still submitting the same data and trusting them to not profile you.</p>\n<p>Local RF location backends like DejaVu require that the phone has a working <abbr title=\"Global Positioning System\">GPS</abbr> first for the local RF data collected to be useful. This makes them less effective as location providers, as the job of a location provider is to assist location approximation when satellite based services are not working.</p>\n<p>If your <a href=\"https://www.privacyguides.org/basics/threat-modeling/\">threat model</a> requires protecting your location or the <abbr title=\"Media Access Control\">MAC</abbr> addresses of nearby devices, rerouting location requests to the <abbr title=\"Operating System\">OS</abbr> location API is probably the best option. The benefit brought by microG's custom location backend is minimal at best when compared to Sandboxed Google Play.</p>\n<p>In terms of application compatibility, <mark>Sandboxed Google Play on GrapheneOS is always going to be more compatible</mark> as it is the same code as what is released by Google. microG is a reimplementation of these services. As a result, it only supports the various parts that have been reimplemented, meaning some things such as <a href=\"https://play.google.com/googleplaygames\">Google Play Games</a> and <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/google/play/billing\">In-app Billing API</a> are not yet supported.</p>\n<p>Larger apps, especially games, require <a href=\"https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2020/06/introducing-google-play-asset-delivery.html\">Play Asset Delivery</a> to be installed, which is currently not implemented in microG. Authentication using <a href=\"https://www.privacyguides.org/basics/multi-factor-authentication#fido-fast-identity-online\"><abbr title=\"Fast IDentity Online\">FIDO</abbr></a> with online services on Android also relies on Play Services, and does not currently work with microG.</p>\n<h2 id=\"privileged-esim-activation-application\">Privileged eSIM Activation Application</h2>\n<p>Currently, eSIM activation is tied to a privileged proprietary application by Google. The app has the <code>READ_PRIVILEGED_PHONE_STATE</code> permission, giving Google access to your hardware identifiers such as the <abbr title=\"International Mobile Equipment Identity\">IMEI</abbr>.</p>\n<p>On GrapheneOS, the app comes disabled, and you can <em>optionally</em> enable it after installing Sandboxed Google Play.</p>\n<p>On CalyxOS, the app comes installed by default (regardless of whether you choose to have microG or not) and you cannot opt out. This means that Google still has access to your hardware identifiers regardless of whether you need eSIM activation, and they can be accessed persistently.</p>\n<h2 id=\"privileged-app-extensions\">Privileged App Extensions</h2>\n<p>Android 12 comes with special support for seamless app updates with <a href=\"https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2020/09/listening-to-developer-feedback-to.html\">third-party app stores</a>. The popular Free and Open-Source Software (FOSS) repository <a href=\"https://f-droid.org\">F-Droid</a> doesn't implement this feature and requires a <a href=\"https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.fdroid.fdroid.privileged\">privileged extension</a> to be included with the Android distribution in order to have unattended app updates.</p>\n<p>CalyxOS includes the <a href=\"https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.fdroid.fdroid.privileged\">privileged extension</a>, which may lower device security.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, GrapheneOS officially recommends <a href=\"https://grapheneos.org/usage#sandboxed-google-play\">Sandboxed Google Play</a> instead. Many FOSS Android apps are also in Google's Play Store, but sometimes they are not (like <a href=\"https://www.privacyguides.org/frontends#newpipe-android\">NewPipe</a>). In those cases, you can <a href=\"https://www.privacyguides.org/android/#manually-with-rss-notifications\">keep up with updates using <abbr title=\"Really Simple Syndication\">RSS</abbr></a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"profiles\">Profiles</h2>\n<p>GrapheneOS significantly improves <a href=\"https://www.privacyguides.org/android/overview#user-profiles\">user profiles</a> in <a href=\"https://grapheneos.org/features#improved-user-profiles\">multiple ways</a>, such as increasing the limit of how many profiles you can create (32 instead of the standard 4), allowing you to log out of user profiles, disabling app installation, and notification forwarding. All of these improvements make it so that user profiles can be daily driven without sacrificing too much usability.</p>\n<p>CalyxOS doesn't feature any improvements to user profiles over <abbr title=\"Android Open Source Project\">AOSP</abbr>, and instead includes a device controller app so that the <a href=\"https://www.privacyguides.org/android/overview#work-profile\">work profile</a> can be used without needing to download a third party app such as <a href=\"https://www.privacyguides.org/android/#shelter\">Shelter</a>. However, work profiles are not nearly as flexible (as you're limited to only one) and don't provide the same amount of isolation and security.</p>\n<h2 id=\"additional-hardening\">Additional Hardening</h2>\n<p>GrapheneOS improves upon <a href=\"https://source.android.com/\"><abbr title=\"Android Open Source Project\">AOSP</abbr></a> security with:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Hardened WebView:</strong> Vanadium WebView requires <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/64-bit_computing\">64-bit</a> processes on the <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/reference/android/webkit/WebView\">WebView</a> process and disables legacy <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/32-bit_computing\">32-bit</a> processes. It uses hardened compiler options such as <a href=\"https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Code-Gen-Options.html\"><code>-fwrapv</code></a> and <a href=\"https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-4.9.3/gcc/Optimize-Options.html\"><code>-fstack-protector-strong</code></a>, which can help protect against <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_buffer_overflow\">stack buffer overflows</a>. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API\">API</a>s such as the <a href=\"https://chromestatus.com/feature/4537134732017664\">battery status API</a> are disabled for privacy reasons. All system apps on GrapheneOS use the Vanadium WebView which means that apps which use WebView will also benefit from Vanadium's hardening. The <a href=\"https://github.com/GrapheneOS/Vanadium\">Vanadium patch set</a> is a lot more comprehensive than CalyxOS's <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/CalyxOS/chromium-patches\">Chromium patch set</a> which is derived from it.</li>\n<li><strong>Hardened Kernel:</strong> GrapheneOS kernel includes some hardening from the <a href=\"https://github.com/GrapheneOS/linux-hardened\">linux-hardened</a> project and the <a href=\"https://kernsec.org/wiki/index.php/Kernel_Self_Protection_Project\">Kernel Self Protection Project (KSPP)</a>. CalyxOS uses the <a href=\"https://calyxos.org/docs/development/build/kernel/\">same kernel</a> as regular Android with some minor modifications.</li>\n<li><strong>Hardened Memory Allocator:</strong> GrapheneOS uses the <a href=\"https://github.com/GrapheneOS/hardened_malloc\">hardened malloc</a> subproject as its memory allocator. This focuses on hardening against <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_corruption\">memory heap corruption</a>. CalyxOS uses the default <abbr title=\"Android Open Source Project\">AOSP</abbr> <a href=\"https://source.android.com/devices/tech/debug/scudo\">Scudo Malloc</a>, which is generally <a href=\"https://twitter.com/danielmicay/status/1033671709197398016\">less effective</a>. Hardened Malloc has uncovered vulnerabilities in <abbr title=\"Android Open Source Project\">AOSP</abbr> which have been <a href=\"https://github.com/GrapheneOS/platform_system_core/commit/be11b59725aa6118b0e1f0712572e835c3d50746\">fixed</a> by GrapheneOS such as <a href=\"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-0703\"><abbr title=\"Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures\">CVE</abbr>-2021-0703</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Secure Exec Spawning:</strong> GrapheneOS <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spawn_(computing)\">spawns</a> fresh processes as opposed to using the <a href=\"https://ayusch.com/android-internals-the-android-os-boot-process\">Zygote model</a> used by <abbr title=\"Android Open Source Project\">AOSP</abbr> and CalyxOS. The Zygote model weakens <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_space_layout_randomization\">Address Space Layout Randomization</a> (ASLR) and is considered <a href=\"https://wenke.gtisc.gatech.edu/papers/morula.pdf\">less secure</a>. Creating <a href=\"https://grapheneos.org/usage#exec-spawning\">fresh processes</a> is safer but will have some performance penalty when launching a new application. These penalties are not really noticeable unless you have an <a href=\"https://support.google.com/nexus/answer/4457705\">old device</a> with slow storage such as the Pixel 3a/3a XL as it has <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MultiMediaCard#eMMC\">eMMC</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Please note that these are just a few examples and are not an extensive list of GrapheneOS's hardening</strong>.

This sent up many red flags for human rights and privacy advocates.<!-- more --></p>\n<p>These concerns were met with \u201cif you have nothing to hide, you have nothing to fear.\u201d The argument goes that if you're not doing anything illegal, then these violations of your privacy shouldn't bother you. If you care about privacy, you clearly can't be up to anything good.</p>\n<p>On the surface, this seems true to many people \u2013 but the reality is very different. We may not have had anything to hide in the immediate aftermath of 9/11, but that was not the only information being sought after by governments. Indeed, following the passage of the Patriot Act in the US, the FBI issued 192,499 <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/other/national-security-letters\">National Security Letters</a>, meaning they collected the records and online activity of nearly 200,000 people.</p>\n<p>In the end it only convicted one person.</p>\n<p>Now, many have argued that stopping one terrorist might be worth giving up some security for, but <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20230318132243/https://www.aclu.org/issues/national-security/privacy-and-surveillance/surveillance-under-patriot-act\">according</a> to the ACLU, the conviction would have occurred without the Patriot Act.</p>\n<p>Many legal actions you take today could be deemed illegal by future laws or future government. In the US today there is discussion around the possibility of Roe v. Wade being overturned, allowing states to outlaw abortions. You may not currently feel the need to hide internet searches, menstrual cycle apps, or donations to women's health clinics today because it's not illegal, but tomorrow that information could be used against you.</p>\n<p>In countries were organizing around political dissent is legal, that doesn't mean the government is tracking those taking part and using that information to create informants or infiltrate such groups. Or worse, when or if laws change, using that surveillance to punish those involved.</p>\n<p>And even if you break away from the legal aspects, we all have something to hide. You may not be ready to reveal your sexual or gender identity, but your internet usage could potentially do that for you. You don't want to make your bank account public; you have that information to hide. And you can continue to list things about your life you'd just rather not make public, regardless of potential legality.</p>\n<p>In July 2021, a Catholic priest by the name of Jeffrey Burrill lost his job and was forced to resign after data collected through his cell phone showed that he was active on the gay dating app Grindr, and that he had visited multiple gay bars in the area. <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/religion/2021/07/20/bishop-misconduct-resign-burrill/\">According</a> to the <em>Washington Post</em>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u201cA mobile device correlated to Burrill emitted app data signals from the location-based hookup app Grindr on a near-daily basis during parts of 2018, 2019, and 2020 \u2014\u2013 at both his USCCB office and his USCCB-owned residence, as well as during USCCB meetings and events in other cities,\u201d the Pillar reported.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe data obtained and analyzed by The Pillar conveys mobile app date signals during two 26-week periods, the first in 2018 and the second in 2019 and 2020. The data was obtained from a data vendor and authenticated by an independent data consulting firm contracted by The Pillar,\u201d the site reported. It did not identify who the vendor was or if the site bought the information or got it from a third party.</p>\n<p>The Pillar story says app data \u201ccorrelated\u201d to Burrill's phone shows the priest visited gay bars, including while traveling for the USCCB.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>While it was not clear who was tracking Burrill's device, the Post went on to say that:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Privacy experts have long raised concerns about \u201canonymized\u201d data collected by apps and sold to or shared with aggregators and marketing companies. While the information is typically stripped of obviously identifying fields, like a user's name or phone number, it can contain everything from age and gender to a device ID. It's possible for experts to de-anonymize some of this data and connect it to real people.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>While Burrill was without a doubt in violation of his work's own code of conduct, he did decide on his own to be a priest. However, his personal life was not harming others and was just that, his personal life.

Our site is in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown\">Markdown</a>, so it should be easy to chip in.</p>\n<h4 id=\"admonitions\">Admonitions</h4>\n<p>Throughout the site we use MkDocs's <a href=\"https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/admonitions/#usage\">admonitions</a>, to show information to readers about the products such as <code>example</code>, <code>warning</code>, <code>tip</code>, etc.</p>\n<p>By default, when admonitions are used they will have an English string on the site. This can be <a href=\"https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/admonitions/#changing-the-title\">customized</a>, without too much effort. For example if you were translating and admonition of type <a href=\"https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/admonitions/#type:warning\">warning</a> to Dutch, this is how you would write it:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><span></span><code>!!! warning &quot;Waarschuwing&quot;\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>Downloads are a <a href=\"https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/admonitions/#custom-admonitions\">custom admonition</a> that we use, and you would write that like:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><span></span><code>??? downloads &quot;Downloaden&quot;\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>The same goes for other types, such as <code>tip</code>, <code>example</code> etc. Recommendations are also admonitions, but they do not need overriding, because the default has no text, so they are always:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><span></span><code>!!! recommendation\n</code></pre></div>\n<h4 id=\"translation-software\">Translation software</h4>\n<p>Translation software gets the translation quite reliable. We've found <a href=\"https://www.deepl.com/en/translator\">DeepL</a> works well however, attention does need to be given that the translated string is correct.</p>\n<p>For example:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><span></span><code>![Software logo](assets/images/path/to/image.svg){ align=right }\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>We have sometimes found that the syntax for inserting an image like above was missing the <code>![</code> or an extra space was placed between the text and the path, e.g. <code>](</code>. If a translation string is clearly not correct, we encourage you to <strong>delete</strong> it by pressing the trash icon <a href=\"https://support.crowdin.com/enterprise/getting-started-for-volunteers/#voting-view\">or vote</a> which one you think sounds best. When invalid strings are deleted they are removed from the organization's <a href=\"https://support.crowdin.com/enterprise/translation-memory\">translation memory</a>, meaning that when the source string is seen again, it won't suggest the incorrect translation.</p>\n<p>We'd like to thank the <a href=\"https://crowdin.com/project/privacyguides/reports/top-members\">translation team</a> who spent many hours on translating the content, that we now have. We're going to launch in Dutch, French and Hebrew.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Share this page:</strong><br />\n<a class=\"md-button\" href=\"https://x.com/intent/tweet?text=Blog%20Post%20Title%20Placeholder&amp;url=https%3A//murateren.github.io/mynotes/blog/2025/05/01/i18n-announcement/&amp;hashtags=PrivacyGuides&amp;via=erenm\" style=\"margin-right: 1em;\">Share on <span class=\"twemoji\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path d=\"M18.901 1.153h3.68l-8.04 9.19L24 22.846h-7.406l-5.8-7.584-6.638 7.584H.474l8.6-9.83L0 1.154h7.594l5.243 6.932ZM17.61 20.644h2.039L6.486 3.24H4.298Z\"/></svg></span></a>\n<a class=\"md-button\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&amp;url=https%3A//murateren.github.io/mynotes/blog/2025/05/01/i18n-announcement/&amp;title=Blog%20Post%20Title%20Placeholder&amp;summary=It%27s%20finally%20here.%20After%20countless%20requests%2C%20Privacy%20Guides%20now%20has%20translations.\">Share on <span class=\"twemoji\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path d=\"M19 3a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H5a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V5a2 2 0 0 1 2-2zm-.5 15.5v-5.3a3.26 3.26 0 0 0-3.26-3.26c-.85 0-1.84.52-2.32 1.3v-1.11h-2.79v8.37h2.79v-4.93c0-.77.62-1.4 1.39-1.4a1.4 1.4 0 0 1 1.4 1.4v4.93zM6.88 8.56a1.68 1.68 0 0 0 1.68-1.68c0-.93-.75-1.69-1.68-1.69a1.69 1.69 0 0 0-1.69 1.69c0 .93.76 1.68 1.69 1.68m1.39 9.94v-8.37H5.5v8.37z\"/></svg></span></a></p>", "image": "https://murateren.github.io/mynotes//assets/images/social/i18n-announcement.png", "date_published": "2025-05-01T10:30:00+00:00", "authors": [{"name": "Murat Eren"}], "tags": ["Announcements", "Privacy Guides"]}, {"id": "https://murateren.github.io/mynotes/blog/2025/05/01/installing-and-using-tails/", "url": "https://murateren.github.io/mynotes/blog/2025/05/01/installing-and-using-tails/", "title": "Blog Post Title Placeholder", "content_html": "<h1 id=\"using-tails-when-your-world-doesnt-feel-safe-anymore\">Using Tails When Your World Doesn't Feel Safe Anymore</h1>\n<p><img alt=\"Photo of a hand plugging a USB stick into a laptop and the Tails logo under it.\" src=\"../../../../assets/images/installing-and-using-tails/cover.webp\" />\n<small aria-hidden=\"true\">Illustration: Jonah Aragon / Privacy Guides | Photo: Aleksander Duma\u0142a / Pexels</small></p>\n<p>There is a growing number of people who no longer feel safe in their own home or country.

However, there are situations where someone might be put in great danger simply for looking at a website.<!-- more --></p>\n<p>While this guide will be applicable to many, I am writing this article with these groups in mind:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Victims of domestic violence,</li>\n<li>Trans and queer individuals living in a hostile environment, and</li>\n<li>Democracy and human rights activists located in regions adverse to their cause.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This article will help people in such situations learn how to browse the internet and use a computer in a more protected and anonymous way, in order to stay safe from harm.</p>\n<div class=\"admonition danger\">\n<p class=\"admonition-title\">A warning for those at very high risk</p>\n<p>If you feel at very high risk in your home or country, and the device you are currently using to read this article could be accessed by a person or group meaning you harm, I recommend you ask a <em>trusted ally</em> who does not experience the same level of threat to complete this tutorial for you on their device instead.

It is kept on a USB stick and resets itself entirely after each use (except if you enable its encrypted password-protected <a href=\"https://tails.net/doc/persistent_storage/index.en.html\">Persistent Storage</a>). What is done on Tails does not leave any digital traces on the computer it is plugged into, hence \"amnesic.\"</p>\n<p>Additionally, Tails comes with pre-installed applications that will help increase your security and privacy online. When accessing the internet from Tails, your traffic will be automatically rerouted through the <a href=\"https://www.privacyguides.org/en/advanced/tor-overview/\">Tor network</a>. This is a special network that makes it very difficult to identify your location or the websites you access, even from your Internet Service Provider (<abbr title=\"Internet Service Provider\">ISP</abbr>).</p>\n<p>However, unless you configure the <a href=\"https://tails.net/doc/anonymous_internet/tor/index.en.html#hiding\">Tor bridge</a> option to hide this, your <abbr title=\"Internet Service Provider\">ISP</abbr> will know you have been using Tor, although they will not know which websites in particular you have visited through Tor. It could have been anything. I personally use Tor when I have to visit Google Maps, just to protect my data from Google's advertising.</p>\n<h2 id=\"why-you-might-want-to-use-tails\">Why you might want to use Tails</h2>\n<p>There are many good and legitimate reasons for using Tails. Here are a few examples from the scenarios I am considering in this article:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>A victim of domestic violence who needs a secure way to research and communicate with shelters or other supportive resources to plan a safe escape, without leaving traces of their activities on a device accessible to the perpetrator.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A trans or queer individual who lives with an unsupportive or hostile family and wishes to research trans or queer-related topics online, find communities, or access supportive resources without leaving any digital traces of their activities on a family device.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A democracy or human rights activist who organizes protests, communicate information online, or carry on any other activities that might have been declared unauthorized by an oppressive regime.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Any other situations where browsing the web or using a device anonymously might be necessary to protect someone's safety.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"when-to-use-tails-and-when-not-to-use-tails\">When to use Tails, and when not to use Tails</h2>\n<p>Tails protects some data very well, but it will not magically protect everything. Before using it, read carefully what it can help you with and what it cannot do.</p>\n<h3 id=\"when-using-tails-might-help-you\">When using Tails might help you</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Browsing the web without leaving traces on your main computer.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Using a computer without leaving traces of your activities on your main computer.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Storing information and processing files in an encrypted way, away from your main computer.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Hiding which websites you visit from your <abbr title=\"Internet Service Provider\">ISP</abbr> by using Tor, without leaving traces on your main computer.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"what-you-should-be-careful-about\">What you should be careful about</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Remember that unless you enable the Tor bridge, your <abbr title=\"Internet Service Provider\">ISP</abbr> will know you have accessed the Tor network. Your government could request this information from your <abbr title=\"Internet Service Provider\">ISP</abbr>. Be careful if this can put you in danger in your country. If you are not using Tails from a public Wi-Fi network, and if revealing to your <abbr title=\"Internet Service Provider\">ISP</abbr> that you are using Tor could be dangerous to you, you should <a href=\"https://tails.net/doc/anonymous_internet/tor/index.en.html#hiding\">enable the Tor bridge option</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Tails cannot protect your anonymity if while using Tails you log into an account that you have already been identified with, or have used outside of Tails. While using Tails, <strong>do not log into anything that you have logged in outside of Tails</strong>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If you communicate with others or create an account within Tails, be mindful not to share any personal details that could identify you while using Tails.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If you share any files, be careful to <strong>remove thoroughly any metadata</strong> that could identify you from the file.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If you share any pictures or videos, be extremely cautious with removing metadata and examining the picture or video to make sure no reflections or other details could inadvertently identify you.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Do not to reuse any usernames, pseudonyms, email addresses, phone numbers, profile pictures, passwords, or any other information that you have used outside of Tails.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Do not do anything that could identify you while using Tails. Assume that everything you do while using Tails could be linked together.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Be careful with using any mobile data network to connect to the internet. Information related to <a href=\"https://tails.net/doc/anonymous_internet/no-wifi/index.en.html\">your mobile device could identify you</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A very powerful adversary, such as a government, could potentially identify some information despite you using Tails. Read more about Tails' limitations here: <a href=\"https://tails.net/doc/about/warnings/index.en.html\">https://tails.net/doc/about/warnings/index.en.html</a></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"when-you-should-not-use-tails\">When you should <strong>not</strong> use Tails</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If someone finding your Tails USB stick could put you in worse danger than not using it at all.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If you have not enabled the Tor bridge option, and your <abbr title=\"Internet Service Provider\">ISP</abbr> or government finding out you have accessed Tor could put you in worse danger than not using it at all.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>When the computer you are using Tails with might be <a href=\"https://tails.net/doc/about/warnings/computer/index.en.html\">compromised at the firmware or hardware level</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>When there are cameras in your environment recording your activity on this computer.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If your computer cannot securely boot from an external USB stick.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"installing-tails\">Installing Tails</h2>\n<p>Before you start, make sure that:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>The device you use for the installation is free from malware or spyware.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>There is no recording software such as <a href=\"https://allthings.how/how-to-turn-off-windows-recall-ai-feature-in-windows-11-copilot-plus-pcs/\">Windows Recall</a> running. If there is, disable or pause it and delete your visit of this website from it.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You have a USB stick with a storage capacity of at least 8 GB. Ideally, I recommend using a fresh and new USB stick, but if this is not accessible to you, make sure you can erase this USB stick entirely and that the files on it were not sensitive or revealing information. Assume your USB stick could get seized later on and these deleted files could potentially get restored.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If you complete this installation for someone else, or if it is safe for you to do so (ordering online leaves a lot of digital footprints!), you may be interested in using a USB stick that looks more like a banal object. You can easily find cheap USB sticks on popular online stores that look like innocuous cartoon keychain charms, for example.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"what-youll-need\">What you'll need</h3>\n<ul class=\"task-list\">\n<li class=\"task-list-item\">\n<p><label class=\"task-list-control\"><input type=\"checkbox\" disabled checked/><span class=\"task-list-indicator\"></span></label> USB stick with a storage capacity of at least 8 GB.</p>\n</li>\n<li class=\"task-list-item\">\n<p><label class=\"task-list-control\"><input type=\"checkbox\" disabled checked/><span class=\"task-list-indicator\"></span></label> A computer with a port compatible with your USB stick (both for installation and usage).</p>\n</li>\n<li class=\"task-list-item\">\n<p><label class=\"task-list-control\"><input type=\"checkbox\" disabled checked/><span class=\"task-list-indicator\"></span></label> A computer running one of these operating systems: Apple computer with <em>Intel</em> processor (not M1-M2-M3) running macOS version 10.10 or later, PC with at least 2 GB of RAM running Windows 7 or later, PC with at least 2 GB of RAM running Linux.</p>\n</li>\n<li class=\"task-list-item\">\n<p><label class=\"task-list-control\"><input type=\"checkbox\" disabled checked/><span class=\"task-list-indicator\"></span></label> Capacity to install new software on the computer you are using for the installation.</p>\n</li>\n<li class=\"task-list-item\">\n<p><label class=\"task-list-control\"><input type=\"checkbox\" disabled checked/><span class=\"task-list-indicator\"></span></label> At least 1-2 hours of free time when you are safe and free from threats.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"admonition warning\">\n<p class=\"admonition-title\">Hardware incompatibility</p>\n<p>You might experience some hardware incompatibilities while running Tails (this is common for Linux-based software on Mac devices).

The community-driven project was first released in 2012 and is a <abbr title=\"A new software project created by copying an existing project and adding to it independently\">fork</abbr> of both the <em>KeePass Password Safe</em> application and <em>KeePassX</em>, which is no longer actively maintained.</p>\n<p>In addition to having its <a href=\"https://github.com/keepassxreboot/keepassxc\">code</a> available for all to see, KeePassXC also went through an independent <a href=\"https://keepassxc.org/blog/2023-04-15-audit-report/\">security review</a> in 2023.</p>\n<p>Because it does not automatically sync with any remote cloud service, KeePassXC works offline by default. This offers additional protections for your privacy, and potentially for your security as well, depending on your specific situation.</p>\n<h3 id=\"platforms\">Platforms</h3>\n<p>KeePassXC can run on Linux, macOS, and Windows computers. There is no direct option for a KeePassXC application on mobile. The KeePassXC team <a href=\"https://keepassxc.org/docs/#faq-platform-mobile\">suggests</a> using <a href=\"https://www.keepassdx.com/\">KeePassDX</a> or <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=keepass2android.keepass2android\">KeePass2Android</a> on Android phones, and <a href=\"https://strongboxsafe.com/\">Strongbox</a> or <a href=\"https://keepassium.com/\">KeePassium</a> on iPhones.</p>\n<h3 id=\"database-cloud-backup\">Database cloud backup</h3>\n<p>KeePassXC is local-first and will not automatically back up your password database in the cloud. This can be both an advantage for security and privacy, and a disadvantage if something were to happen to your device.</p>\n<p>To prevent losing access to your passwords, it is recommended to regularly back up your encrypted database <code>.kdbx</code> file in a remote <a href=\"https://www.privacyguides.org/en/cloud/\">cloud storage</a> of your choice, or on an encrypted external drive or USB stick.</p>\n<p>When copying this file to a third-party cloud service, it will <a href=\"https://keepassxc.org/docs/KeePassXC_UserGuide#_storing_your_database\">remain fully encrypted</a> and only get decrypted locally on your device. That being said, it's still always best to select an end-to-end encrypted cloud storage whenever possible.</p>\n<h3 id=\"feature-overview\">Feature overview</h3>\n<p>This tutorial only covers the basic installation to get you ready using KeePassXC locally, with a main password secured with a YubiKey. However, KeePassXC offers a lot of features you might also want to have a look at.</p>\n<p>In addition to the features we will set up here, KeePassXC offers the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://keepassxc.org/docs/KeePassXC_UserGuide#_passkeys\">Passkey support</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://keepassxc.org/docs/KeePassXC_UserGuide#_password_generator\">Password generator</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://keepassxc.org/docs/KeePassXC_UserGuide#_command_line_tool\">Command line tool</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://keepassxc.org/docs/KeePassXC_UserGuide#_ssh_agent_integration\"><abbr title=\"Secure Shell\">SSH</abbr> agent integration</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://keepassxc.org/docs/KeePassXC_UserGuide#_database_sharing_with_keeshare\">KeeShare and groups</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://keepassxc.org/docs/KeePassXC_UserGuide#_importing_databases\">Import password databases from 1Password, Bitwarden, Proton Pass, KeePass, <abbr title=\"Comma-Separated Values\">CSV</abbr> files</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://keepassxc.org/docs/KeePassXC_UserGuide#_exporting_databases\">Export databases to <abbr title=\"Comma-Separated Values\">CSV</abbr>, HTML, or XML files</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://keepassxc.org/docs/KeePassXC_GettingStarted#_features\">And more</a></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"whats-new-with-keepassxc-2710\">What's new with KeePassXC 2.7.10</h3>\n<p>On March 4th, KeePassXC released its most recent update.

The default settings are already good, but you might want to tweak a few things to your specific usage.</p>\n<h4 id=\"keep-a-previous-version-backup-recommended\">Keep a previous version backup (recommended)</h4>\n<p>Scrolling down to the \"File Management\" section, you might want to enable the option to \"Backup database file before saving\". This will ensure you always have a backup of the previous version of your database, in case you accidentally delete important information for example.</p>\n<p>You can store this backup in the same or a different directory. You can change this backup's name or keep the default that will append <code>.old</code> to your database filename.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Screenshot of the KeePassXC application showing the Settings General section with the Backup database file before saving checkbox checked.\" src=\"../../../../assets/images/installing-keepassxc-and-yubikey/keepassxc-5-backupprevious.webp\" /></p>\n<h4 id=\"add-icons-specific-to-each-service-optional\">Add icons specific to each service (optional)</h4>\n<p>If you want to use icons specific to each service for your password entries, you can go to the \"Security\" subsection on the left-side menu, then in \"Privacy\" at the bottom <em>enable</em> \"Use DuckDuckGo service to download website icons\". This isn't enabled by default. Then click \"OK\" on the lower-right.</p>\n<div class=\"admonition warning\">\n<p class=\"admonition-title\">Offline only?</p>\n<p>Do not enable this if you wish to use KeePassXC offline only.

For example, you could have a database for work, a database for your family, and a database for your personal accounts. All stored in separate files with separate main passwords. In the application, each database can be opened in its own tab.</p>\n<p>To create a new database, from the Welcome section click on the \"Create Database\" button on the lower-left.</p>\n<p>If you want to create a secondary database, you can also click on the dropdown Database menu on the application menu bar, then select \"New Database\".</p>\n<div class=\"admonition tip\">\n<p class=\"admonition-title\">Importing an existing database</p>\n<p>If you already have a password database file in the format <code>.kdbx</code>, you can import it from the Welcome page by clicking on \"Import File\" on the lower-right.</p>\n</div>\n<p>You will see a window pop up with \"General Database Information\". Pick a name and description for your database and click on \"Continue\" at the bottom.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Screenshot of the KeePassXC application showing the popup to Create a new KeePassXC database.\" src=\"../../../../assets/images/installing-keepassxc-and-yubikey/keepassxc-7-databasecreation.webp\" /></p>\n<p>For the second step, an \"Encryption Settings\" section will pop up. From there, you will be able to change the settings to your preferences. If you are not familiar with encryption algorithms, simply keep the defaults on and click \"Continue\" again.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Screenshot of the KeePassXC application showing the popup to Create a new KeePassXC database in the Encryption Settings.\" src=\"../../../../assets/images/installing-keepassxc-and-yubikey/keepassxc-8-databaseencryption.webp\" /></p>\n<p>For the next step, a \"Database Credentials\" section will pop up. From there, you will be able to choose a main password to lock your entire password database.</p>\n<p>At this step, it is very important to <a href=\"https://www.privacyguides.org/en/basics/passwords-overview/#best-practices\">choose a password</a> that is <strong>unique, complex, and long</strong>. This is the password that will protect all your other passwords. It should be easy to remember for you, but it must be <em>unique</em> and <em>long</em>. Ideally, pick a <strong>passphrase</strong>.</p>\n<h4 id=\"generate-a-main-password-optional\">Generate a main password (optional)</h4>\n<p>If you do not feel inspired, you can use the \"Generate password\" dice button on the right to help you pick a strong password.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Screenshot of the KeePassXC application showing the popup to Generate Password.\" src=\"../../../../assets/images/installing-keepassxc-and-yubikey/keepassxc-9-passwordgenerate.webp\" /></p>\n<p>No matter if you invent or generate your main password/passphrase, <strong>make sure to remember this main password well</strong>. You cannot rely on your password manager for this one.</p>\n<div class=\"admonition success\">\n<p class=\"admonition-title\">This step isn't over yet!</p>\n<p>This is where you will be adding your YubiKey to further secure your database.

Let's get into it!</p>\n<p><strong><em>Em:</em></strong> <em>Hi Micah! We're thrilled that you have accepted to give us this interview at Privacy Guides. Thank you for taking time off your busy schedule to talk with us.</em></p>\n<h2 id=\"cyd-the-app-to-claw-back-your-data-from-big-tech\">Cyd: The app to claw back your data from Big Tech</h2>\n<p><strong><em>Em:</em></strong> <em>Let's start with your newest project. <a href=\"https://cyd.social\">Cyd</a> is an application you have created in 2024 to help people backing up and deleting their tweets on X-(Twitter). This app emerged from the ashes of <a href=\"https://micahflee.com/2024/07/like-a-phoenix-semiphemeral-will-rise-from-the-ashes/\">Semiphemeral</a>, a great tool that was unfortunately rendered unusable when Twitter decided to <a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/twitter-ending-free-api-tier-elon-musk-worst-decision\">shut off its API</a>. I personally loved Semiphemeral and used it to delete thousands of my tweets before eventually deleting my whole Twitter account later on. Can you tell us more about how Cyd works despite not using X's API?</em></p>\n<p><strong>Micah:</strong></p>\n<p>APIs make it way simpler for programmers to interact with online services, but they're not the only way. As long as social media platforms like X still run websites, and it's still possible for you, the human, to manually scroll through your tweets and delete them, it's possible to write a program that can do this for you.</p>\n<p>This is basically how Cyd works. It's a desktop app that includes an embedded web browser. When you add an X account to it, you login to your account in the browser, and then Cyd takes over. You can tell it that you want to delete your tweets, or likes, or bookmarks, or unfollow everyone, or save a backup of your DMs, or plenty of other things, and it does this by automating the embedded browser on your behalf. No API required.</p>\n<p>Cyd uses open APIs when they're available and make sense. For example, if you want to quit X but you don't want your old tweets to disappear forever, Cyd can migrate them to Bluesky using Bluesky's API -- soon we'll add support for migrating to Mastodon too. But for closed platforms that suck (like X, and Facebook too, which we're adding support for right now), we're forced to do it the hard way.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Em:</em></strong> <em>Talking about openness, recently this year you have decided to <a href=\"https://infosec.exchange/@micahflee/113885066507235250\">make Cyd open source</a>. This is fantastic news! What did you take into consideration before making this decision and what kind of <a href=\"https://github.com/lockdown-systems/cyd\">contributions</a> or feedback are you hoping to receive from the community?</em></p>\n<p><strong>Micah:</strong></p>\n<p>I'm extremely happy that Cyd is now open source. I've open-sourced most code that I've ever written, so it honestly felt kind of weird starting out making Cyd proprietary.</p>\n<p>My biggest concern with making it open was that I want Cyd to be a sustainable business, where some of the features are free and some of the features are premium and cost money -- enough so that me, and eventually other people working on it, could get paid a decent wage. And as an open source app, it would be easy for someone to <abbr title=\"A new software project created by copying an existing project and adding to it independently\">fork</abbr> it and remove the bits of code that check if you've paid for premium access.</p>\n<p>But after talking it through with some other people who are very experienced open source devs, I decided that this isn't that big of a deal, and that the benefits of being open source far outweigh the costs.</p>\n<p>Now when you use Cyd, you can now <em>confirm</em> that it doesn't have access to your social media accounts or any of the data in it. Having an open issue tracker on GitHub is great too, because people in the community can open issues, post comments, and track the progress of features they're looking forward to. Also being open source means we have the ability to accept grants and donations, in addition to selling premium accounts. You can check out our Open Collective page at\u00a0<a href=\"https://opencollective.com/lockdown-systems\">https://opencollective.com/lockdown-systems</a>.</p>\n<p>I'm hoping that members of the community will discuss features we're making, or even contribute code directly to our project. Right now, Cyd is only available in English, but we're also hoping to translate it into many different languages going forward, so I'm hoping that people will eventually chip in it to help translate Cyd to their native languages.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Em:</em></strong> <em>Having access to Cyd in multiple languages would really be wonderful. Likewise for multiple social media, when additional ones will be added later on. But at the moment, Cyd definitely seems to be <a href=\"https://cyd.social/want-to-quit-x-in-2025-heres-how-to-do-it-the-right-way-with-cyd/\">focusing</a> on X. You have personally been on the receiving end of Elon Musk's vengeful whims before when your Twitter account got <a href=\"https://micahflee.com/2023/05/elon-banned-me-from-twitter-for-doing-journalism-good-riddance/\">banned</a> in 2022 for criticizing him. I would say this qualifies as a badge of honor. Do you think you could still be on his radar with Cyd focusing on <a href=\"https://cyd.social/delete-all-your-tweets-for-free-with-cyd/\">data deletion for X</a> even though X has shut off its API? Have you taken any specific measures about this?</em></p>\n<p><strong>Micah:</strong></p>\n<p>I think it's actually more likely that I'll be on Elon Musk's radar because of my <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/live/APHo7bea_p4?si=stSrkmo1MWy5_iVX&amp;t=3338\">recent work</a> with the Tesla Takedown movement than with Cyd... Right now, Musk is spending all of his time purging the US government of critics and consolidating executive power under Trump. So maybe he's too distracted on his fascism project to care about what we're doing with deleting tweets?</p>\n<p>But that said, Musk is litigious and we're definitely concerned about legal threats. We've consulted lawyers and we're trying to be as safe as possible.</p>\n<h2 id=\"lockdown-systems-the-new-organization-developing-cyd\">Lockdown Systems: The new organization developing Cyd</h2>\n<p><strong><em>Em:</em></strong> <em>Cyd is a project of <a href=\"https://lockdown.systems\">Lockdown Systems</a>, a new organization you have created with colleagues just a few months ago. Can you tell us more about the structure of this organization and who else is involved?</em></p>\n<p><strong>Micah:</strong></p>\n<p>We're still finalizing the paperwork, but Lockdown Systems is a new worker-owned collective! At the moment there are five of us:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>me</li>\n<li>Jen, a former SecureDrop engineer who was the technical editor of my book and, for several years, my Dungeons &amp; Dragons dungeon master</li>\n<li>Saptak, a talented human-rights-focused open source developer who I work with on OnionShare</li>\n<li>Yael, an investigative journalist friend who, among other things, broke a story with me about how Zoom had lied about supporting end-to-end encryption just as everyone started using it during the pandemic</li>\n<li>Akil, a talented newsroom engineer I worked closely with at The Intercept</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Most companies are owned by investors who only care about profit. They don't care about the workers, and they definitely don't care about the end-users of the software they make. This is why it's so common for tech companies to end up spying on their users and selling that data: it's an additional way to make a profit for their investors.</p>\n<p>We're different. Lockdown Systems is owned by its workers, and we don't have outside investors. We have all agreed to the explicit goals of: ensuring the well-being of our members; making tools that help fight fascism and authoritarianism; and prioritizing impact over profit.</p>\n<p>We make decisions by coming to consensus, and everyone in the collective gets paid the same wage. Even though I started Cyd, I don't have more say than anyone else.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Em:</em></strong> <em>That is such a great organizational structure for software development. Lockdown Systems really has an impressive team of skilled and dedicated people. Presently, it seems from the website and <a href=\"https://github.com/lockdown-systems\">GitHub page</a> that Lockdown Systems is focusing on developing and growing Cyd only. Are you planning on using Lockdown Systems mainly for Cyd or are you envisaging other applications getting added to Lockdown Systems in the near (or far) future?</em></p>\n<p><strong>Micah:</strong></p>\n<p>So far, Cyd is our only product. There are many features we plan on building, and we also need to get it the point where it can fund our continued work. Most likely, this will be our main project for the near future.</p>\n<p>That said, we're definitely open to branching out. We make software that directly empowers individuals, helping them reclaim their autonomy and privacy. So if we see an opportunity to build something that will directly help people who are facing fascist threats -- whether it's supporting abortion access, keeping immigrants safe, helping communities organize mutual aid, etc. -- we will absolutely do it.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Em:</em></strong> <em>If one day some generous millionaire (let's keep it at millionaire, we all know what happens at billionaire) decided to give Lockdown Systems a huge budget bump no string attached, how would you like to grow the organization with this money?</em></p>\n<p><strong>Micah:</strong></p>\n<p>One cool thing about being a member of a collective is that if this happened, the whole collective would brainstorm together and we'd come up with ideas that are far better than what I could come up with alone. But that said, I definitely have some thoughts.</p>\n<p>Right now, everyone is working part time, between about 10 and 30 hours a week each. If we had the resources, many of us would work on Cyd full-time, and we'd be able to offer benefits like health care and retirement contributions. We could also increase how many people are part of the collective, and build out new features at a much faster rate.</p>\n<p>In my mind, future Cyd will be a single app (possible available on mobile devices, not just desktop) where you can have total control over all of your data that's currently stored by tech companies (X, Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, LinkedIn, Reddit, Bluesky, Mastodon, Discord, Slack, Telegram, Amazon, Airbnb, Substack, and on and on). You can backup all your data and then have choice over where you want the rest of it: you can delete <em>everything</em>, or you can choose to keep your online presence that you're proud of. You can easily cross-post to multiple platforms, and also automatically delete your older posts from the corporate platforms, while keeping them live on the open ones. Or, however else you choose to do it.</p>\n<p>If we had a bigger team to pay for more labor, there's a lot that we could get done.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Em:</em></strong> <em>In the meantime, I imagine one million $1 donations could also help. If our readers would like to support the development of Lockdown Systems, they can make a <a href=\"https://opencollective.com/lockdown-systems\">donation on this page</a>.</em></p>\n<h2 id=\"onionshare-the-app-to-share-files-host-websites-and-chat-anonymously-through-tor\">OnionShare: The app to share files, host websites, and chat anonymously through Tor</h2>\n<p><strong><em>Em:</em></strong> <em>Our community is likely familiar with this great application included in so many security and privacy-focused projects, including <a href=\"https://tails.net/\">Tails</a>, <a href=\"https://www.qubes-os.org/\">Qubes <abbr title=\"Operating System\">OS</abbr></a>, <a href=\"https://www.whonix.org/\">Whonix</a>, and <a href=\"https://parrotsec.org/\">Parrot <abbr title=\"Operating System\">OS</abbr></a>. What motivated you to create <a href=\"https://onionshare.org\">OnionShare</a> more than 10 years ago, and what do you think is the best way to use it now?</em></p>\n<p><strong>Micah:</strong></p>\n<p>I made OnionShare in 2014 while I was helping journalists report on the Snowden documents. The big motivation was a border search: Glenn Greenwald's partner, David, traveled from Berlin, where he was visiting Laura Poitras, back to his home in Rio de Janeiro. He was carrying an encrypted hard drive, on an assignment for The Guardian. During his layover at Heathrow airport in London, UK authorities detained him and searched him.</p>\n<p>None of this was necessary. Using the internet, encryption, and Tor, it's possible to securely move documents around the world without putting anyone at risk at a border crossing. In fact, I was already doing something similar with journalists I was collaborating with on Snowden stories myself. To send someone secret documents, I'd first encrypt them using <abbr title=\"Pretty Good Privacy (see OpenPGP)\">PGP</abbr>, and then place them in a folder on my laptop. I'd start up a web server with a simple directory listing for that folder, and then make that web server accessible as a Tor onion service.</p>\n<p>While this wasn't too hard for me, an experienced Linux nerd, to set up, it would be very challenging for most people. I made OnionShare basically as a user-friendly way for anyone to be able to securely share files, peer-to-peer, without needing to first upload them to some third party service like Dropbox.</p>\n<p>Today, OnionShare has more features. It's basically like a graphical interface to do cool things with Tor onion services -- you can send files, but you can also turn your laptop into an anonymous dropbox so people can upload files to you, and you can quickly host onion websites and spin up temporary chatrooms too. And there are Android and iPhone apps!</p>\n<p>The last time I used OnionShare myself was last week. On my personal newsletter, I'm writing a <a href=\"https://micahflee.com/exploring-the-paramilitary-leaks/\">series of posts</a> exploring the Paramilitary Leaks, 200 GB of data from the American militia movement, obtained by an infiltrator name John Williams. While working on one of my posts, John used OnionShare to send me some additional documents.</p>\n<h2 id=\"other-projects-and-thoughts\">Other projects and thoughts</h2>\n<p><strong><em>Em:</em></strong> <em>You have been a prolific writer as a journalist for <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/staff/micah-lee/\">The Intercept</a>, your own <a href=\"https://micahflee.com/\">Blog</a>, and in January 2024 you <a href=\"https://micahflee.com/2023/12/hacks-leaks-and-revelations-the-art-of-analyzing-hacked-and-leaked-data/\">released</a> a book called Hacks, Leaks, and Revelations: The Art of Analyzing Hacked and Leaked Data. What is this book about, and who is it written for?</em></p>\n<p><strong>Micah:</strong></p>\n<p>I spent many years reporting on hacked and leaked datasets, starting with the Snowden archive. Since then, I've seen the amount of hacked and leaked data grow exponentially. And at the same time, journalists and researchers -- the people who really need to dig through this data and find the good stories -- don't even know where to start.</p>\n<p>So that's what my book is, an interactive guide to downloading and exploring datasets. It doesn't require any prior knowledge, but it does get pretty technically, including two chapters teaching Python programming. If you're following along, near the beginning of the book you'll encrypt a USB hard drive and then download a copy of BlueLeaks to it -- hundreds of gigabytes of hacked police documents from the middle of the Black Lives Matter uprising in 2020. You'll use this dataset, along with several others, as examples as you learn how to make sense of data like this.</p>\n<p>You should definitely buy the book if you're interested and you can, but information wants to be free, so I also released the whole book under a Creative Commons license. You can read the whole thing online at <a href=\"https://hacksandleaks.com/\">hacksandleaks.com</a>.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Em:</em></strong> <em>I can see how much of a valuable skill this is to learn for journalists and researchers in this day and age. Even if nothing compares to having a physical paper copy (in my opinion), it's wonderful that you share your book online for people who, for various reasons, cannot order a copy. You have worked or still work with the Electronic Frontier Foundation, Freedom of the Press Foundation, Science &amp; Design, the Tor Project, and Distributed Denial of Secrets. Your contribution and commitment to digital rights is undeniable. From your experience, what are you envisioning for the future of digital rights activism?</em></p>\n<p><strong>Micah:</strong></p>\n<p>I don't have all of the answers, but I do think that it's important for digital rights activists to meet the moment. Fascist politicians are gaining power around the world. The gap between the ultra rich and everyone else is wider than it's ever been before. Elon Musk has openly bought the US government, and the Trump-supporting oligarchs control all of our critical tech infrastructure. Climate change deniers and anti-vaxxers are the ones in charge right now, at least in the US. Things are pretty bad.</p>\n<p>Whatever we do, we should have the goal of shifting power away from the fascists and billionaires and towards everyone else. We need alternative platforms that are not only open and democratic, but also just as easy to use as the corporate walled gardens. We need digital rights, not to mention digital security, to fully integrate itself into the rest of the mass movements going on now, whether it's to save the planet from climate change, to protect immigrants getting sent to gulags, or to stop the genocide in Gaza.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Em:</em></strong> <em>Absolutely, and digital rights advocates and organizations undeniably have a crucial role to play in these movements. Finally, is there anything else you would like to share with us that we haven't discussed yet?</em></p>\n<p><strong>Micah:</strong></p>\n<p>If you want to support Lockdown Systems and you work for an organization that might be interested in offering Cyd as a benefit to their employees, check out Cyd for Teams!

You'll have to make trade-offs here between security and convenience: A longer password will be annoying to type in every time, but a shorter password or PIN will be easier to guess. Setting up Face ID or Touch ID along with a strong password can be a good compromise between usability and security.</p>\n<p>Select <strong>Turn Passcode On</strong> or <strong>Change Passcode</strong> &gt; <strong>Passcode Options</strong> &gt; <strong>Custom Alphanumeric Code</strong>. Make sure that you create a <a href=\"https://www.privacyguides.org/basics/passwords-overview/\">secure password</a>.</p>\n<p>If you wish to use Face ID or Touch ID, you can go ahead and set it up now. Your phone will use the password you set up earlier as a fallback in case your biometric verification fails. Biometric unlock methods are primarily a convenience, although they do stop surveillance cameras or people over your shoulder from watching you input your passcode.</p>\n<p>If you use biometrics, you should know how to turn them off quickly in an emergency. Holding down the side or power button and <em>either</em> volume button until you see the Slide to Power Off slider will disable biometrics, requiring your passcode to unlock. Your passcode will also be required after device restarts.</p>\n<p>On some older devices, you may have to press the power button five times to disable biometrics instead, or for devices with Touch ID you may just have to hold down the power button and nothing else. Make sure you try this in advance, so you know which method works for your device.</p>\n<p><strong>Allow Access When Locked</strong> gives you options for what you can allow when your phone is locked. The more of these options you disable, the less someone without your password can do, but the less convenient it will be for you.

We don't recommend installing beta software on your phone. Beta releases are potentially unstable and could have undiscovered security vulnerabilities.</p>\n<h3 id=\"before-first-unlock\">Before First Unlock</h3>\n<p>If your threat model includes forensic tools, and you want to minimize the chance of exploits being used to access your phone, you should restart your device frequently. The state <em>after</em> a reboot but <em>before</em> unlocking your device is referred to as \"Before First Unlock\" (BFU), and when your device is in that state it makes it <a href=\"https://belkasoft.com/checkm8_glossary\">significantly more difficult</a> for forensic tools to exploit vulnerabilities to access your data. This BFU state allows you to receive notifications for calls, texts, and alarms, but most of the data on your device is still encrypted and inaccessible. This can be impractical, so consider whether these trade-offs make sense for your situation.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Share this page:</strong><br />\n<a class=\"md-button\" href=\"https://x.com/intent/tweet?text=Blog%20Post%20Title%20Placeholder&amp;url=https%3A//murateren.github.io/mynotes/blog/2025/05/01/ios-configuration-guide/&amp;hashtags=iOS&amp;via=erenm\" style=\"margin-right: 1em;\">Share on <span class=\"twemoji\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path d=\"M18.901 1.153h3.68l-8.04 9.19L24 22.846h-7.406l-5.8-7.584-6.638 7.584H.474l8.6-9.83L0 1.154h7.594l5.243 6.932ZM17.61 20.644h2.039L6.486 3.24H4.298Z\"/></svg></span></a>\n<a class=\"md-button\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&amp;url=https%3A//murateren.github.io/mynotes/blog/2025/05/01/ios-configuration-guide/&amp;title=Blog%20Post%20Title%20Placeholder&amp;summary=There%20are%20a%20number%20of%20privacy%20and%20security-related%20settings%20you%20should%20consider%20changing%20in%20the%20Settings%20app%20on%20iOS%2016.\">Share on <span class=\"twemoji\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path d=\"M19 3a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H5a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V5a2 2 0 0 1 2-2zm-.5 15.5v-5.3a3.26 3.26 0 0 0-3.26-3.26c-.85 0-1.84.52-2.32 1.3v-1.11h-2.79v8.37h2.79v-4.93c0-.77.62-1.4 1.39-1.4a1.4 1.4 0 0 1 1.4 1.4v4.93zM6.88 8.56a1.68 1.68 0 0 0 1.68-1.68c0-.93-.75-1.69-1.68-1.69a1.69 1.69 0 0 0-1.69 1.69c0 .93.76 1.68 1.69 1.68m1.39 9.94v-8.37H5.5v8.37z\"/></svg></span></a></p>\n<div class=\"footnote\">\n<hr />\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn:1\">\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apple-fbi-icloud-exclusive-idUSKBN1ZK1CT\">Reuters - Exclusive: Apple dropped plan for encrypting backups after FBI complained</a>&#160;<a class=\"footnote-backref\" href=\"#fnref:1\" title=\"Jump back to footnote 1 in the text\">&#8617;</a></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>", "image": "https://murateren.github.io/mynotes//assets/images/social/ios-configuration-guide.png", "date_published": "2025-05-01T10:30:00+00:00", "authors": [{"name": "Murat Eren"}], "tags": ["Tutorials", "iOS"]}, {"id": "https://murateren.github.io/mynotes/blog/2025/05/01/job-openings/", "url": "https://murateren.github.io/mynotes/blog/2025/05/01/job-openings/", "title": "Blog Post Title Placeholder", "content_html": "<h1 id=\"privacy-guides-is-hiring\">Privacy Guides is Hiring</h1>\n<p>We are thrilled to announce the opening of three new job positions aimed at enhancing our mission of promoting personal privacy and informed digital choices.

Applications installed from the package manager (<code>dnf</code>, <code>apt</code>, etc.) typically have <strong>no</strong> sandboxing or confinement whatsoever. Below are a few projects that aim to solve this problem:<!-- more --></p>\n<h2 id=\"flatpak\">Flatpak</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://flatpak.org\">Flatpak</a> aims to be a universal package manager for Linux. One of its main functions is to provide a universal package format which can be used in most Linux distributions. It provides some <a href=\"https://docs.flatpak.org/en/latest/sandbox-permissions.html\">permission control</a>. However, <a href=\"https://madaidans-insecurities.github.io/linux.html#flatpak\">it is known</a> that Flatpak sandboxing could be improved as particular Flatpaks often have greater permission than required. There does seem to be <a href=\"https://theevilskeleton.gitlab.io/2021/02/11/response-to-flatkill-org.html\">some agreement</a> that this is the case.</p>\n<p>You can restrict applications further by issuing <a href=\"https://docs.flatpak.org/en/latest/flatpak-command-reference.html#flatpak-override\">Flatpak overrides</a>. This can be done with the command-line or by using <a href=\"https://flathub.org/apps/details/com.github.tchx84.Flatseal\">Flatseal</a>. Some sample overrides are provided by <a href=\"https://github.com/rusty-snake/kyst/tree/main/flatpak\">rusty-snake</a>.</p>\n<p>We generally recommend revoking access to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the Network (<code>share=network</code>) socket (internet access)</li>\n<li>the PulseAudio socket (for both audio in and out), <code>device=all</code> (access to all devices including the camera)</li>\n<li><code>org.freedesktop.secrets</code> dbus (access to secrets stored on your keychain) for applications which do not need it</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If an application works natively with Wayland (and not running through the <a href=\"https://wayland.freedesktop.org/xserver.html\">XWayland</a> compatibility layer), consider revoking its access to the X11 (<code>socket=x11</code>) and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_domain_socket\">Inter-process communications (IPC)</a> socket (<code>share=ipc</code>) as well.</p>\n<p>We also recommend restricting broad filesystem permissions such as <code>filesystem=home</code> and <code>filesystem=host</code> which should be revoked and replaced with just the directories that the app needs to access. Some applications like <a href=\"https://www.flathub.org/apps/details/org.videolan.VLC\">VLC</a> implement the <a href=\"https://docs.flatpak.org/en/latest/portal-api-reference.html\">Portals</a> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API\">API</a>, which allows a file manager to pass files to the Flatpak application (e.g. VLC) without specific filesystem access privileges. VLC is only able to access the specific file that you want to open, rather than requiring privileges to particular locations.</p>\n<p>Hard-coded access to some kernel interfaces like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sysfs\"><code>/sys</code></a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procfs#Linux\"><code>/proc</code></a> and weak <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seccomp\">seccomp</a> filters unfortunately cannot be secured with Flatpak.</p>\n<h2 id=\"firejail\">Firejail</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://firejail.wordpress.com/\">Firejail</a> is another method of sandboxing. As it is a large <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Setuid\">setuid</a> binary, it has a large <abbr title=\"The total number of possible entry points for unauthorized access to a system\">attack surface</abbr> which may assist in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privilege_escalation\">privilege escalation</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://madaidans-insecurities.github.io/linux.html#firejail\">This post from a Whonix security researcher</a> provides additional details on how Firejail can worsen the security of your device.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mandatory-access-control\">Mandatory Access Control</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandatory_access_control\">Mandatory access control</a> systems require policy files in order to force constraints on the system.</p>\n<p>The two main control systems are <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security-Enhanced_Linux\"><abbr title=\"Security-Enhanced Linux\">SELinux</abbr></a> (used on Android and Fedora) and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AppArmor\">AppArmor</a>.</p>\n<p>Fedora includes <abbr title=\"Security-Enhanced Linux\">SELinux</abbr> preconfigured with some policies that will confine <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daemon_(computing)\">system daemons</a> (background processes). We don\u2019t recommend disabling <abbr title=\"Security-Enhanced Linux\">SELinux</abbr>.</p>\n<p>openSUSE gives the choice of AppArmor or <abbr title=\"Security-Enhanced Linux\">SELinux</abbr> during the installation process. We recommend sticking to the default for each variant (AppArmor for <a href=\"https://get.opensuse.org/tumbleweed/\">Tumbleweed</a> and <abbr title=\"Security-Enhanced Linux\">SELinux</abbr> for <a href=\"https://microos.opensuse.org/\">MicroOS</a>). openSUSE\u2019s <abbr title=\"Security-Enhanced Linux\">SELinux</abbr> policies are derived from Fedora.</p>\n<p>Arch and Arch-based operating systems often do not come with a mandatory access control system and that must be configured manually for either <a href=\"https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/AppArmor\">AppArmor</a> or <a href=\"https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/SELinux\"><abbr title=\"Security-Enhanced Linux\">SELinux</abbr></a>.</p>\n<p>Linux desktops don't usually include individual app confinement rules, unlike Android which sandboxes every application installed.</p>\n<h2 id=\"making-your-own-policiesprofiles\">Making your own policies/profiles</h2>\n<p>You can make your own AppArmor profiles, <abbr title=\"Security-Enhanced Linux\">SELinux</abbr> policies, Bubblewrap profiles, and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seccomp\">seccomp</a> blacklist to have better confinement of applications.

Containers are more common in server and development environments where individual apps are built to operate independently.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docker_(software)\">Docker</a> is one of the most common container solutions. It does not run a proper sandbox, and this means that there is a large kernel <abbr title=\"The total number of possible entry points for unauthorized access to a system\">attack surface</abbr>. The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daemon_(computing)\">daemon</a> controls everything and <a href=\"https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/rootless/#known-limitations\">typically</a> runs as root. If it crashes for some reason, all the containers will crash too. The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GVisor\">gVisor</a> runtime which implements an application level kernel can help limit the number of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_call\">syscalls</a> an application can make and can help isolate it from the host\u2019s <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(operating_system)\">kernel</a>.</p>\n<p>Red Hat develops <a href=\"https://docs.podman.io/en/latest/\">Podman</a> and secures it with <abbr title=\"Security-Enhanced Linux\">SELinux</abbr> to <a href=\"https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/apparmor-selinux-isolation\">isolate</a> containers from each other. One of the notable differences between Docker and Podman is that Docker requires <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superuser\">root</a> while Podman can run with <a href=\"https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/09/25/rootless-containers-with-podman-the-basics\">rootless containers</a> that are also <a href=\"https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2018/08/29/intro-to-podman\">daemonless</a>, meaning if one crashes they don\u2019t all come down.</p>\n<p>Another option is <a href=\"https://katacontainers.io/\">Kata containers</a>, where virtual machines masquerade as containers. Each Kata container has its own Linux kernel and is isolated from the host.</p>\n<p>The above container technologies can be useful if you want to run certain web app software on your local network, such as <a href=\"https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden\">Vaultwarden</a> or images provided by <a href=\"https://www.linuxserver.io\">LinuxServer.io</a>, to increase privacy by decreasing dependence on various web services.

If you're on a Red Hat based distribution, such as Fedora this can be done with the following commands:</p>\n<div class=\"admonition example\">\n<p class=\"admonition-title\">Example</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><span></span><code>firewall-cmd<span class=\"w\"> </span>--set-default-zone<span class=\"o\">=</span>drop<span class=\"p\">;</span>\nfirewall-cmd<span class=\"w\"> </span>--add-protocol<span class=\"o\">=</span>ipv6-icmp<span class=\"w\"> </span>--permanent<span class=\"p\">;</span>\nfirewall-cmd<span class=\"w\"> </span>--add-service<span class=\"o\">=</span>dhcpv6-client<span class=\"w\"> </span>--permanent<span class=\"p\">;</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n</div>\n<p>All these firewalls use the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netfilter\">Netfilter</a> framework and therefore cannot protect against malicious programs running on the system. A malicious program could insert its own rules.</p>\n<p>If you are using Flatpak packages, you can revoke their network socket access using Flatseal and prevent those applications from accessing your network. This permission is not bypassable.</p>\n<p>If you are using non-classic <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snap_(package_manager)\">Snap</a> packages on a system with proper snap confinement support (with both AppArmor and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cgroups\"><abbr title=\"Control Groups\">cgroups</abbr></a> v1 present), you can use the Snap Store to revoke network permission as well. This is also not bypassable.</p>\n<h2 id=\"kernel-hardening\">Kernel hardening</h2>\n<p>Kernel hardening options such as configuring <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sysctl#Linux\">sysctl</a> keys and <a href=\"https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/kernel-parameters.html\">kernel command-line parameters</a> can help harden your system. We suggest looking at the following <a href=\"https://madaidans-insecurities.github.io/guides/linux-hardening.html#sysctl\">sysctl settings</a> and <a href=\"https://madaidans-insecurities.github.io/guides/linux-hardening.html#boot-parameters\">boot parameters</a>.</p>\n<p>We <strong>strongly</strong> recommend that you learn what these options do before applying them. There are also some methods of <a href=\"https://madaidans-insecurities.github.io/guides/linux-hardening.html#kernel-attack-surface-reduction\">kernel <abbr title=\"The total number of possible entry points for unauthorized access to a system\">attack surface</abbr> reduction</a> and <a href=\"https://madaidans-insecurities.github.io/guides/linux-hardening.html#restricting-sysfs\">access restrictions to sysfs</a> that can further improve security.</p>\n<div class=\"admonition note\">\n<p class=\"admonition-title\">Note</p>\n<p>Unprivileged <a href=\"https://madaidans-insecurities.github.io/linux.html#kernel\">user namespaces</a> can be disabled, due to it being responsible for various privileged escalation vulnerabilities. Some software such as Docker, Podman, and LXC require unprivileged user namespaces to function. If you use these tools you should not disable <code>kernel.unprivileged_userns_clone</code>.</p>\n<p>Disabling access to <code>/sys</code> without a proper whitelist will lead to various applications breaking. This will unfortunately be an extremely tedious process for most users. Kicksecure, and by extension, Whonix, has an experimental <a href=\"https://github.com/Kicksecure/security-misc/blob/master/lib/systemd/system/hide-hardware-info.service\">hide hardware info service</a> which does just this. From our testing, these work perfectly fine on minimal Kicksecure installations and both Qubes-Whonix Workstation and Gateway. If you are using Kicksecure or Whonix, we recommend that you follow the <a href=\"https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Security-misc\">Kicksecure Wiki</a> to enable hide hardware info service.</p>\n</div>\n<h2 id=\"linux-hardened\">Linux-Hardened</h2>\n<p>Some distributions like Arch Linux have the <a href=\"https://github.com/anthraxx/linux-hardened\">linux-hardened</a>, kernel package. It includes <a href=\"https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/security#Kernel_hardening\">hardening patches</a> and more security-conscious defaults. Linux-Hardened has <code>kernel.unprivileged_userns_clone=0</code> disabled by default. See the <a href=\"#kernel-hardening\">note above</a> about how this might impact you.</p>\n<h2 id=\"linux-kernel-runtime-guard-lkrg\">Linux Kernel Runtime Guard (LKRG)</h2>\n<p>LKRG is a kernel module that performs runtime integrity check on the kernel to help detect exploits against the kernel. LKRG works in a <em>post</em>-detect fashion, attempting to respond to unauthorized modifications to the running Linux kernel. While it is <a href=\"https://lkrg.org/\">bypassable by design</a>, it does stop off-the-shelf malware that does not specifically target LKRG itself. This may make exploits harder to develop and execute on vulnerable systems.</p>\n<p>If you can get LKRG and maintain module updates, it provides a worthwhile improvement to security. Debian based distributions can get the LKRG DKMS package from KickSecure's secure repository and the <a href=\"https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Linux_Kernel_Runtime_Guard_LKRG\">KickSecure documentation</a> has instructions.</p>\n<p>On Fedora, <a href=\"https://github.com/fepitre\">fepitre</a>, a QubesOS developer has a <a href=\"https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/fepitre/lkrg/\">COPR repository</a> where you can install it. Arch based systems can obtain the LKRG DKMS package via an <a href=\"https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/lkrg-dkms\">AUR package</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"grsecurity\">GRSecurity</h2>\n<p>GRSecurity is a set of kernel patches that attempt to improve security of the Linux kernel. It requires <a href=\"https://grsecurity.net/purchase\">payment to access</a> the code and is worth using if you have a subscription.</p>\n<h2 id=\"simultaneous-multithreading-smt\">Simultaneous multithreading (SMT)</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simultaneous_multithreading\">SMT</a> has been the cause of numerous hardware vulnerabilities, and subsequent patches for those vulnerabilities often come with performance penalties that negate most of the performance gain given by SMT. If you followed the \u201ckernel hardening\u201d section above, some kernel parameters already disable SMT. If the option is available to you, we recommend that you disable it in your firmware as well.</p>\n<h2 id=\"hardened-memory-allocator\">Hardened memory allocator</h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://github.com/GrapheneOS/hardened_malloc\">hardened memory allocator</a> from <a href=\"https://grapheneos.org\">GrapheneOS</a> can also be used on general Linux distributions. It is available as an <a href=\"https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Security#Hardened_malloc\">AUR package</a> on Arch based distributions, and (though not enabled by default) on Whonix and Kicksecure.</p>\n<p>If you are using Whonix, Kicksecure or the AUR package, consider setting up <code>LD_PRELOAD</code> as described in the <a href=\"https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Hardened_Malloc\">Kicksecure Documentation</a> or <a href=\"https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Security#Hardened_malloc\">Arch Wiki</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"umask\">Umask</h2>\n<p>If you are not using openSUSE, consider changing the default <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umask\">umask</a> for both regular user accounts and root to 077. Changing umask to 077 can break snapper on openSUSE and is <strong>not</strong> recommended.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mount-point-hardening\">Mount point hardening</h2>\n<p>Consider adding the <a href=\"https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/mount.8.html\">following options</a> <code>nodev</code>, <code>noexec</code>, and <code>nosuid</code> to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_(computing)\">mount points</a> which do not need them. Typically, these could be applied to <code>/boot</code>, <code>/boot/efi</code>, and <code>/var</code>.</p>\n<p>These flags could also be applied to <code>/home</code> and <code>/root</code> as well, however, <code>noexec</code> will prevent applications from working that require binary execution in those locations. This includes products such as Flatpak and Snap.</p>\n<p>If you use <a href=\"https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fedora-silverblue/toolbox/\">Toolbox</a>, <code>/var/log/journal</code> must not have any of those options. If you are on Arch Linux, do not apply <code>noexec</code> to <code>/var/tmp</code>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"disabling-suid\">Disabling <abbr title=\"Set Owner User ID\">SUID</abbr></h2>\n<p><abbr title=\"Set Owner User ID\">SUID</abbr> allows a user to execute an application as the owner of that application, which in many cases, would be the <code>root</code> user. Vulnerable <abbr title=\"Set Owner User ID\">SUID</abbr> executables could lead to privilege escalation vulnerabilities.</p>\n<p>It is desirable to remove <abbr title=\"Set Owner User ID\">SUID</abbr> from as many binaries as possible; however, this takes substantial effort and trial and error on the user's part, as some applications require <abbr title=\"Set Owner User ID\">SUID</abbr> to function.</p>\n<p>Kicksecure, and by extension, Whonix has an experimental <a href=\"https://github.com/Kicksecure/security-misc/blob/master/lib/systemd/system/permission-hardening.service\">permission hardening service</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/Kicksecure/security-misc/tree/master/etc/permission-hardening.d\">application whitelist</a> to automate <abbr title=\"Set Owner User ID\">SUID</abbr> removal from most binaries and libraries on the system. From our testing, these work perfectly fine on a minimal Kicksecure installation and both Qubes-Whonix Workstation and Gateway.</p>\n<p>If you are using Kicksecure or Whonix, we recommend that you follow the <a href=\"https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/SUID_Disabler_and_Permission_Hardener\">Kicksecure Wiki</a> to enable the permission hardener.</p>\n<p>Users of other distributions can adapt the permission hardener to their own system based on the source code linked above.</p>\n<h2 id=\"secure-time-synchronization\">Secure Time Synchronization</h2>\n<p>Most Linux distributions by default (especially Arch based distributions with <code>systemd-timesyncd</code>) use unencrypted <abbr title=\"Network Time Protocol\">NTP</abbr> for time synchronization. Securing <abbr title=\"Network Time Protocol\">NTP</abbr> can be achieved by <a href=\"https://fedoramagazine.org/secure-ntp-with-nts/\">configuring NTS with chronyd</a> or by using <a href=\"https://github.com/Kicksecure/sdwdate\">swdate</a> on Debian based distributions.</p>\n<h2 id=\"linux-pluggable-authentication-modules-pam\">Linux Pluggable Authentication Modules (<abbr title=\"Linux Pluggable Authentication Modules\">PAM</abbr>)</h2>\n<p>The security of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_PAM\"><abbr title=\"Linux Pluggable Authentication Modules\">PAM</abbr></a> can be <a href=\"https://madaidans-insecurities.github.io/guides/linux-hardening.html#pam\">hardened</a> to allow secure authentication to your system.</p>\n<p>On Red Hat distributions you can use <a href=\"https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/8/html/configuring_authentication_and_authorization_in_rhel/configuring-user-authentication-using-authselect_configuring-authentication-and-authorization-in-rhel\"><code>authselect</code></a> to configure this e.g.:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><span></span><code>sudo<span class=\"w\"> </span>authselect<span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"k\">select</span><span class=\"w\"> </span>&lt;profile_id,<span class=\"w\"> </span>default:<span class=\"w\"> </span>sssd&gt;<span class=\"w\"> </span>with-faillock<span class=\"w\"> </span>without-nullok<span class=\"w\"> </span>with-pamaccess\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>On systems where <a href=\"https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/pam_tally.8.html\"><code>pam_faillock</code></a> is not available, consider using <a href=\"https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/pam_tally.8.html\"><code>pam_tally2</code></a> instead.</p>\n<h2 id=\"usb-port-protection\">USB port protection</h2>\n<p>To better protect your <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB\">USB</a> ports from attacks such as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BadUSB\">BadUSB</a>, we recommend <a href=\"https://github.com/USBGuard/usbguard\">USBGuard</a>. USBGuard has <a href=\"https://github.com/USBGuard/usbguard#documentation\">documentation</a> as does the <a href=\"https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/USBGuard\">Arch Wiki</a>.</p>\n<p>Another alternative option if you\u2019re using the <a href=\"#linux-hardened\">linux-hardened</a> is the <a href=\"https://github.com/GrapheneOS/linux-hardened/commit/96dc427ab60d28129b36362e1577b6673b0ba5c4\"><code>deny_new_usb</code></a> sysctl. See <a href=\"https://blog.lizzie.io/preventing-usb-attacks-with-linux-hardened.html\">Preventing USB Attacks with <code>linux-hardened</code></a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"secure-boot\">Secure Boot</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Extensible_Firmware_Interface#Secure_Boot\">Secure Boot</a> can be used to secure the boot process by preventing the loading of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography\">unsigned</a> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Extensible_Firmware_Interface\"><abbr title=\"Unified Extensible Firmware Interface\">UEFI</abbr></a> drivers or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootloader\">bootloaders</a>.</p>\n<p>One of the problems with Secure Boot, particularly on Linux is, that only the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_loading#Chain_loading_in_boot_manager_programs\">chain loader</a> (shim), the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootloader\">bootloader</a> (GRUB), and the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(operating_system)\">kernel</a> are verified and that's where verification stops. The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_ramdisk\">initramfs</a> is often left unverified, unencrypted, and open up the window for an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evil_maid_attack\">evil maid</a> attack. The firmware on most devices is also configured to trust Microsoft's keys for Windows and its partners, leading to a large attacks surface.</p>\n<p>To eliminate the need to trust Microsoft's keys, follow the \"Using your own keys\" section on the <a href=\"https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Unified_Extensible_Firmware_Interface/Secure_Boot\">Arch Wiki</a>. The important thing that needs to be done here is to replace the <abbr title=\"Original Equipment Manufacturer\">OEM</abbr>'s key with your own Platform Key.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you enroll your own keys as described above, and your distribution supports Secure Boot by default, you can add your distribution's EFI Key into the list of trusted keys (db keys). It can then be enrolled into the firmware. Then, you should move all of your keys off your local storage device.</li>\n<li>If you enroll your own keys as described above, and your distribution does <strong>not</strong> support Secure Boot out of the box (like Arch Linux), you have to leave the keys on the disk and setup automatic signing of the <a href=\"https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Unified_Extensible_Firmware_Interface/Secure_Boot#Signing_the_kernel_with_a_pacman_hook\">kernel</a> and bootloader. If you are using Grub, you can install it with the <code>--no-shim-lock</code> option and remove the need for the chain loader.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The second option is creating an <a href=\"https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Unified_kernel_image\">EFI Boot Stub</a> that contains the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(operating_system)\">kernel</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_ramdisk\">initramfs</a>, and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microcode\">microcode</a>. This EFI stub can then be signed. If you use <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dracut_(software)\">dracut</a> this can easily be done with the <a href=\"https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/dracut.8.html\"><code>--uefi-stub</code> switch</a> or the <a href=\"https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/dracut.conf.5.html\"><code>uefi_stub</code> config</a> option. This option also requires you to leave the keys on the disk to set up automatic signing, which weakens the security model.</p>\n<p>After setting up Secure Boot it is crucial that you set a \u201cfirmware password\u201d (also called a \u201csupervisor password\u201d, \u201cBIOS password\u201d or \u201c<abbr title=\"Unified Extensible Firmware Interface\">UEFI</abbr> password\u201d), otherwise an adversary can simply disable Secure Boot.</p>\n<p>These recommendations can make you a little more resistant to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evil_maid_attack\">evil maid</a> attacks, but they are not good as a proper verified boot process such as that found on <a href=\"https://source.android.com/security/verifiedboot\">Android</a>, <a href=\"https://www.chromium.org/chromium-os/chromiumos-design-docs/security-overview/#verified-boot\">ChromeOS</a>, <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208198\">macOS</a>, or <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/information-protection/secure-the-windows-10-boot-process\">Windows</a>.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Share this page:</strong><br />\n<a class=\"md-button\" href=\"https://x.com/intent/tweet?text=Blog%20Post%20Title%20Placeholder&amp;url=https%3A//murateren.github.io/mynotes/blog/2025/05/01/linux-system-hardening/&amp;hashtags=Linux%2CSecurity&amp;via=erenm\" style=\"margin-right: 1em;\">Share on <span class=\"twemoji\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path d=\"M18.901 1.153h3.68l-8.04 9.19L24 22.846h-7.406l-5.8-7.584-6.638 7.584H.474l8.6-9.83L0 1.154h7.594l5.243 6.932ZM17.61 20.644h2.039L6.486 3.24H4.298Z\"/></svg></span></a>\n<a class=\"md-button\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&amp;url=https%3A//murateren.github.io/mynotes/blog/2025/05/01/linux-system-hardening/&amp;title=Blog%20Post%20Title%20Placeholder&amp;summary=There%20are%20a%20number%20of%20procedures%20you%20can%20follow%20to%20make%20your%20Linux%20desktop%20system%20more%20secure%2C%20some%20more%20advanced%20than%20others.%20We%20cover%20some%20general%20techniques%20here.\">Share on <span class=\"twemoji\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path d=\"M19 3a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H5a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V5a2 2 0 0 1 2-2zm-.5 15.5v-5.3a3.26 3.26 0 0 0-3.26-3.26c-.85 0-1.84.52-2.32 1.3v-1.11h-2.79v8.37h2.79v-4.93c0-.77.62-1.4 1.39-1.4a1.4 1.4 0 0 1 1.4 1.4v4.93zM6.88 8.56a1.68 1.68 0 0 0 1.68-1.68c0-.93-.75-1.69-1.68-1.69a1.69 1.69 0 0 0-1.69 1.69c0 .93.76 1.68 1.69 1.68m1.39 9.94v-8.37H5.5v8.37z\"/></svg></span></a></p>", "image": "https://murateren.github.io/mynotes//assets/images/social/linux-system-hardening.png", "date_published": "2025-05-01T10:30:00+00:00", "authors": [{"name": "Murat Eren"}], "tags": ["Linux", "Security", "Tutorials"]}]}
