There are approximately 10,000 relays and bridges on the Tor network compared to ~50,000 on I2P, meaning there is potentially more ways for your traffic to be routed to maximize anonymity. I2P also tends to be more performant than Tor, although this is likely a side effect of Tor being more focused on regular \"clearnet\" internet traffic and thus using more bottle necked exit nodes. Hidden service performance is generally considered to be much better on I2P compared to Tor. While running P2P applications like BitTorrent is challenging on Tor (and can massively impact Tor network performance), it is very easy and performant on I2P.</p> <p>There are downsides to I2P's approach, however. Tor relying on dedicated exit nodes means more people in less safe environments can use it, and the relays that do exist on Tor are likely to be more performant and stable, as they generally aren't run on residential connections. Tor is also far more focused on browser privacy (i.e. anti-fingerprinting), with a dedicated Tor Browser to make browsing activity as anonymous as possible. I2P is used via your regular web browser, and while you can configure your browser to be more privacy-protecting, you probably still won't have the same browser fingerprint as other I2P users (there's no \"crowd\" to blend in with in that regard).</p> <ol> <li> <p>The <code>IsolateDestAddr</code> setting is discussed on the Tor mailing list and Whonix's Stream Isolation documentation, where both projects suggest that it is usually not a good approach for most people.

It uses the  ActivityPub protocol, which is decentralized like email: users can exist on different servers or even different platforms but still communicate with each other.</p> <p> Homepage </p> <p>There are many software platforms which use ActivityPub as their backend social networking protocol, meaning they can talk to servers even when they are running different software. For example, PeerTube is a video publishing software that uses ActivityPub, meaning you can follow channels on PeerTube either with another PeerTube account, or with a Mastodon account because Mastodon also uses ActivityPub.</p> <p>We chose to recommend Mastodon over other ActivityPub software as your primary social media platform for these reasons:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Mastodon has a solid history of security updates. In the handful of circumstances where major security vulnerabilities have been found, they coordinate patch releases quickly and cleanly. Historically they have also backported these security patches to older feature branches. This makes it easier for less experienced server hosts who may not feel comfortable upgrading to the latest releases right away to keep their instances secure. Mastodon also has an update notification system built in to the web interface, making it much more likely for server administrators to be aware of critical security patches available for their instance.</p> </li> <li> <p>Mastodon is largely usable with most content types. While it is primarily a microblogging platform, Mastodon easily handles longer posts, image posts, video posts, and most other posts you might encounter when following ActivityPub users who aren't on Mastodon. This makes your Mastodon account an ideal \"central hub\" for following anyone regardless of the platform they chose to use. In contrast, if you were only using a PeerTube account, you would only be able to follow other video channels, for example.</p> </li> <li> <p>Mastodon has fairly comprehensive privacy controls. It has many built-in features which allow you to limit how and when your data is shared, some of which we'll cover below. They also develop new features with privacy in mind. For example, while other ActivityPub software quickly implemented \"quote posts\" by merely handling links to other posts with a slightly different embed modal, Mastodon is developing a quote post feature which will give you more fine-grained control when your post is quoted.</p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"social-networks/#choosing-an-instance","title":"Choosing an Instance","text":"<p>To benefit the most from Mastodon, it is critical to choose a server, or \"instance,\" which is well aligned with the type of content you want to post or read about. While censorship in Mastodon does not exist on a network level, it is very possible to experience censorship on a server level depending on your server's administrator.</p> <p>It is critical to understand that Mastodon is not a single, unified service in the way that X (Twitter) or Facebook are. Each server is its own legal entity, with its own privacy policy, terms of use, administration team, and moderators. While many of these servers are far less restrictive and more privacy-respecting than traditional social media platforms, some can be far more restrictive or potentially worse for your privacy. The Mastodon software does not discriminate between these administrators or place any limitations on their powers.</p> <p>We do not currently recommend any specific instances, but you may find advice within our communities. We recommend avoiding mastodon.social and mastodon.online because they are operated by the same company which develops Mastodon itself. From the perspective of decentralization, it is better in the long term to separate software developers and server hosts so that no one party can exert too much control over the network as a whole.</p> <p>If you are greatly concerned about an existing server censoring your content or the content you can view, you generally have two options:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Host Mastodon yourself. This approach gives you the exact same censorship resistance as any other website you can host yourself, which is fairly high. Mastodon even integrates with the Tor network for more extreme scenarios where even your underlying hosting provider is subject to censorship, but this may limit who can access your content to only other servers which integrate with Tor, like most other hidden services.</p> <p>Mastodon benefits greatly from a large and active self-hosting community, and its administration is comprehensively documented. While many other ActivityPub platforms can require extensive technical knowledge to run and troubleshoot, Mastodon has very stable and tested releases, and it can generally be run securely without issue by anyone who can use the Linux command line and follow step-by-step instructions.</p> </li> <li> <p>Use a managed hosting service. We don't have any specific recommendations, but there are a variety of Mastodon hosting services which will create a brand-new Mastodon server on your own domain (or occasionally a subdomain of their domain, but we recommend against this unless registering your own domain presents too much of a burden to your privacy).</p> <p>Typically, Mastodon hosting providers will handle the technical side of your instance, but they completely leave the moderation side up to you. This means that you will be able to follow any content you like, although it may expose you to more spam or unwanted content because you will not have the dedicated moderation team many larger instances will have.</p> <p>This often represents a better approach than self-hosting for most people, because you can benefit from greater control over your own instance without worrying about technical problems or unpatched security vulnerabilities.</p> <p>You should look closely at your hosting provider's terms of service and acceptable use policies before registering. These are often far more broad than typical hosted instance rules, and they are far less likely to be enforced without recourse, but they can still be restrictive in undesirable ways.</p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"social-networks/#recommended-privacy-settings","title":"Recommended Privacy Settings","text":"<p>From Mastodon's web interface, click the Administration link in the right sidebar.

Individuals and organizations can also share information over the Tor network with \".onion hidden services\" without compromising their privacy. Because Tor traffic is difficult to block and trace, Tor is an effective censorship circumvention tool.</p> <p>Detailed Tor Overview   Video: Why You Need Tor</p> <p>Tip</p> <p>Before connecting to Tor, please ensure you've read our overview on what Tor is and how to connect to it safely. We often recommend connecting to Tor through a trusted VPN provider, but you have to do so properly to avoid decreasing your anonymity.</p> <p>There are a variety of ways to connect to the Tor network from your device, the most commonly used being the Tor Browser, a fork of Firefox designed for  anonymous browsing for desktop computers and Android.</p> <p>Some of these apps are better than others, and again making a determination comes down to your threat model. If you are a casual Tor user who is not worried about your ISP collecting evidence against you, using mobile browser apps like Onion Browser to access the Tor network is probably fine. Increasing the number of people who use Tor on an everyday basis helps reduce the bad stigma of Tor, and lowers the quality of \"lists of Tor users\" that ISPs and governments may compile.</p> <p>If more complete anonymity is paramount to your situation, you should only be using the desktop Tor Browser client, ideally in a Whonix + Qubes configuration. Mobile browsers are less common on Tor (and more fingerprintable as a result), and other configurations are not as rigorously tested against deanonymization.</p>"},{"location":"tor/#tor-browser","title":"Tor Browser","text":"<p>Tor Browser is the choice if you need anonymity, as it provides you with access to the Tor network and bridges, and it includes default settings and extensions that are automatically configured by the default security levels: Standard, Safer and Safest.</p> <p> Homepage </p> Downloads <ul> <li> Google Play</li> <li> Android</li> <li> Windows</li> <li> macOS</li> <li> Linux</li> </ul> <p>Danger</p> <p>You should never install any additional extensions on Tor Browser or edit <code>about:config</code> settings, including the ones we suggest for Firefox. Browser extensions and non-standard settings make you stand out from others on the Tor network, thus making your browser easier to fingerprint.</p> <p>The Tor Browser is designed to prevent fingerprinting, or identifying you based on your browser configuration. Therefore, it is imperative that you do not modify the browser beyond the default security levels.</p> <p>In addition to installing Tor Browser on your computer directly, there are also operating systems designed specifically to connect to the Tor network such as Whonix on Qubes OS, which provide even greater security and protections than the standard Tor Browser alone.</p>"},{"location":"tor/#onion-browser-ios","title":"Onion Browser (iOS)","text":"<p>Onion Browser is an open-source browser that lets you browse the web anonymously over the Tor network on iOS devices and is endorsed by the Tor Project.

To avoid having our system administrator pay server costs out of their own pocket, we changed the donation methods listed on the site from BurungHantu's personal PayPal and crypto accounts to a new OpenCollective page on October 31, 2019. This had the added benefits of making our finances completely transparent, a value we strongly believe in, and tax-deductible in the United States, because they were being held by the Open Collective Foundation 501(c)3.

Jonah had been operating nearly every PrivacyTools service and acting as the de facto project lead for website development in BurungHantu's absence, thus his departure was a significant change to the organization.

This way, we would be able to cleanly redirect all PrivacyTools resources to the new site without any interruption in service. This decision was made many months in advance and communicated to the entire team in the hopes that BurungHantu would reach out and assure his continued support for the project, because with a recognizable brand name and large communities online, moving away from \"PrivacyTools\" was the least desirable possible outcome.</p> <p>In mid-2021 the PrivacyTools team reached out to Jonah, who agreed to rejoin the team to help with the transition.</p>"},{"location":"about/privacytools/#community-call-to-action","title":"Community Call to Action","text":"<p>At the end of July 2021, we informed the PrivacyTools community of our intention to choose a new name and continue the project on a new domain, to be chosen on 2nd August 2022.

He subsequently deleted many of these posts when it was pointed out by the community that he had been absent and abandoned the project.</p> <p>At this point, BurungHantu claimed he wanted to continue working on privacytools.io on his own and requested that we remove the redirect from <code>www.privacytools.io</code> to www.privacyguides.org. We obliged and requested that he keep the subdomains for Matrix, Mastodon, and PeerTube active for us to run as a public service to our community for at least a few months, in order to allow users on those platforms to easily migrate to other accounts. Due to the federated nature of the services we provided, they were tied to specific domain names making it very difficult to migrate (and in some cases impossible).</p> <p>Unfortunately, because control of the r/privacytoolsIO Subreddit was not returned to BurungHantu at his demand (further information below), those subdomains were cut off at the beginning of October, ending any migration possibilities to any users still using those services.</p> <p>Following this, BurungHantu made false accusations about Jonah stealing donations from the project.

There is no need to disable your VPN before connecting to Tor, as some online resources would lead you to believe.</p> <p>Connecting directly to Tor will make your connection stand out to any local network administrators or your ISP. Detecting and correlating this traffic has been done in the past by network administrators to identify and deanonymize specific Tor users on their network. On the other hand, connecting to a VPN is almost always less suspicious, because commercial VPN providers are used by everyday consumers for a variety of mundane tasks like bypassing geo-restrictions, even in countries with heavy internet restrictions.</p> <p>Therefore, you should make an effort to hide your IP address before connecting to the Tor network. You can do this by simply connecting to a VPN (through a client installed on your computer) and then accessing Tor as normal, through Tor Browser for example. This creates a connection chain like:</p> <ul> <li> You \u2192 VPN \u2192 Tor \u2192 Internet</li> </ul> <p>From your ISP's perspective, it looks like you're accessing a VPN normally (with the associated cover that provides you). From your VPN's perspective, they can see that you are connecting to the Tor network, but nothing about what websites you're accessing. From Tor's perspective, you're connecting normally, but in the unlikely event of some sort of Tor network compromise, only your VPN's IP would be exposed, and your VPN would additionally have to be compromised to deanonymize you.</p> <p>This is not censorship circumvention advice, because if Tor is blocked entirely by your ISP, your VPN likely is as well. Rather, this recommendation aims to make your traffic blend in better with commonplace VPN user traffic, and provide you with some level of plausible deniability by obscuring the fact that you're connecting to Tor from your ISP.</p> <p>We very strongly discourage combining Tor with a VPN in any other manner.

As long as you avoid these non-default configurations, you're probably fine.</p> <p>VPN/SSH Fingerprinting</p> <p>The Tor Project notes that theoretically using a VPN to hide Tor activities from your ISP may not be foolproof. VPNs have been found to be vulnerable to website traffic fingerprinting, where an adversary can still guess what website is being visited, because all websites have specific traffic patterns.</p> <p>Therefore, it's not unreasonable to believe that encrypted Tor traffic hidden by a VPN could also be detected via similar methods. There are no research papers on this subject, and we still consider the benefits of using a VPN to far outweigh these risks, but it is something to keep in mind.</p> <p>If you still believe that pluggable transports (bridges) provide additional protection against website traffic fingerprinting that a VPN does not, you always have the option to use a bridge and a VPN in conjunction.</p> <p>Determining whether you should first use a VPN to connect to the Tor network will require some common sense and knowledge of your own government's and ISP's policies relating to what you're connecting to. However, again in most cases you will be better off being seen as connecting to a commercial VPN network than directly to the Tor network. If VPN providers are censored in your area, then you can also consider using Tor pluggable transports (e.g. Snowflake or meek bridges) as an alternative, but using these bridges may arouse more suspicion than standard WireGuard/OpenVPN tunnels.</p>"},{"location":"advanced/tor-overview/#what-tor-is-not","title":"What Tor is Not","text":"<p>The Tor network is not the perfect privacy protection tool in all cases, and has a number of drawbacks which should be carefully considered.

Because Tor exit nodes can be created by anybody, they are hotspots for network logging and modification.

Other exit node attacks such as replacing downloads via unencrypted channels with malware have also been observed.

Something to consider is that while bridges may provide adequate censorship circumvention, this is only a transient benefit. They do not adequately protect you from your ISP discovering you connected to Tor in the past with historical traffic log analysis.</p> <p>To illustrate this point, consider the following scenario: You connect to Tor via a bridge, and your ISP doesn\u2019t detect it because they are not doing sophisticated analysis of your traffic, so things are working as intended. Now, 4 months go by, and the IP of your bridge has been made public. This is a very common occurrence with bridges, they are discovered and blocked relatively frequently, just not immediately.</p> <p>Your ISP wants to identify Tor users 4 months ago, and with their limited metadata logging they can see that you connected to an IP address which was later revealed to be a Tor bridge. You have virtually no other excuse to be making such a connection, so the ISP can say with very high confidence that you were a Tor user at that time.</p> <p>Contrast this with our recommended scenario, where you connect to Tor via a VPN. Say that 4 months later your ISP again wants to identify anybody who used Tor 4 months ago. Their logs almost certainly can identify your traffic 4 months ago, but all they would likely be able to see is that you connected to a VPN\u2019s IP address. This is because most ISPs only retain metadata over long periods of time, not the full contents of the traffic you request. Storing the entirety of your traffic data would require a massive quantity of storage which nearly all threat actors wouldn't possess.</p> <p>Because your ISP almost certainly is not capturing all packet-level data and storing it forever, they have no way of determining what you connected to with that VPN after the fact with an advanced technique like deep packet inspection, and therefore you have plausible deniability.</p> <p>Therefore, bridges provide the most benefit when circumventing internet censorship in the moment, but they are not an adequate substitute for all the benefits that using a VPN alongside Tor can provide. Again, this is not advice against using Tor bridges, you should just be aware of these limitations while making your decision. In some cases bridges may be the only option (if all VPN providers are blocked, for instance), so you can still use them in those circumstances with this limitation in mind.</p> <p>If you think that a bridge can aid in defending against fingerprinting or other advanced network analysis more than a VPN's encrypted tunnel already can, you always have the option to use a bridge in conjunction with a VPN as well. That way you are still protected by the pluggable transport's obfuscation techniques even if an adversary gains some level of visibility into your VPN tunnel. If you decide to go this route, we recommend connecting to an obfs4 bridge behind your VPN for optimal fingerprinting protection, rather than meek or Snowflake.</p> <p>It is possible that the WebTunnel pluggable transport currently being trialed may mitigate some of these concerns.

The IzzyOnDroid repository pulls builds directly from code forges (GitHub, GitLab, etc.) and is the next best thing to the developers' own repositories. They also offer reproducible builds for hundreds of applications and have developers who verify the reproducibility of developer-signed APKs.

Whenever you see something along the lines of \"Sign in with provider name\" on a registration form, it's typically using OAuth.</p> <p>When you sign in with OAuth, it will open a login page with the provider you choose, and your existing account and new account will be connected. Your password won't be shared, but some basic information typically will (you can review it during the login request). This process is needed every time you want to log in to the same account.</p> <p>The main advantages are:</p> <ul> <li>Security: You don't have to trust the security practices of the service you're logging into when it comes to storing your login credentials because they are stored with the external OAuth provider. Common OAuth providers like Apple and Google typically follow the best security practices, continuously audit their authentication systems, and don't store credentials inappropriately (such as in plain text).</li> <li>Ease-of-use: Multiple accounts are managed by a single login.</li> </ul> <p>But there are disadvantages:</p> <ul> <li>Privacy: The OAuth provider you log in with will know the services you use.</li> <li>Centralization: If the account you use for OAuth is compromised, or you aren't able to log in to it, all other accounts connected to it are affected.</li> </ul> <p>OAuth can be especially useful in those situations where you could benefit from deeper integration between services. Our recommendation is to limit using OAuth to only where you need it, and always protect the main account with MFA.</p> <p>All the services that use OAuth will be as secure as your underlying OAuth provider's account. For example, if you want to secure an account with a hardware key, but that service doesn't support hardware keys, you can secure the account you use with OAuth with a hardware key instead, and now you essentially have hardware MFA on all your accounts. It is worth noting though that weak authentication on your OAuth provider account means that any account tied to that login will also be weak.</p> <p>There is an additional danger when using Sign in with Google, Facebook, or another service, which is that typically the OAuth process allows for bidirectional data sharing. For example, logging in to a forum with your Twitter account could grant that forum access to do things on your Twitter account such as post, read your messages, or access other personal data. OAuth providers will typically present you with a list of things you are granting the external service access to, and you should always ensure that you read through that list and don't inadvertently grant the external service access to anything it doesn't require.</p> <p>Malicious applications, particularly on mobile devices where the application has access to the WebView session used for logging in to the OAuth provider, can also abuse this process by hijacking your session with the OAuth provider and gaining access to your OAuth account through those means.

There are many legal documents and contracts where a legal identity is required. This could range from opening a bank account, signing a property lease, obtaining a passport, customs declarations when importing items, or otherwise dealing with your government.

It is not anonymous because it doesn't change. If you're part of an online community, you may wish to retain a persona that others know. This pseudonym isn't anonymous because\u2014if monitored for long enough\u2014details about the owner can reveal further information, such as the way they write, their general knowledge about topics of interest, etc.</p> <p>You may wish to use a VPN for this, to mask your IP address. Financial transactions are more difficult to mask: You could consider using anonymous cryptocurrencies, such as Monero. Employing altcoin shifting may also help to disguise where your currency originated. Typically, exchanges require KYC (know your customer) to be completed before they'll allow you to exchange fiat currency into any kind of cryptocurrency. Local meet-up options may also be a solution; however, those are often more expensive and sometimes also require KYC.</p> </li> <li> <p>Anonymous identity - Even with experience, anonymous identities are difficult to maintain over long periods of time. They should be short-term and short-lived identities which are rotated regularly.</p> <p>Using Tor can help with this.

VPN providers can also see and modify your traffic the same way your ISP could, so there is still a level of trust you are placing in them. And there is no way to verify a VPN provider's \"no logging\" policies in any way.</p>"},{"location":"basics/vpn-overview/#when-isnt-a-vpn-suitable","title":"When isn't a VPN suitable?","text":"<p>Using a VPN in cases where you're using your real-life or well-known identity online is unlikely to be useful. Doing so may trigger spam and fraud detection systems, such as if you were to log into your bank's website.</p> <p>It's important to remember that a VPN will not provide you with absolute anonymity because the VPN provider itself will still have access to your real IP address, destination website information, and often a money trail that can be linked directly back to you. \"No logging\" policies are merely a promise; if you need complete safety from the network itself, consider using Tor in addition to or instead of a VPN.</p> <p>You also should not trust a VPN to secure your connection to an unencrypted, HTTP destination. In order to keep what you actually do on the websites you visit private and secure, you must use HTTPS. This will keep your passwords, session tokens, and queries safe from the VPN provider and other potential adversaries in between the VPN server and your destination. You should enable HTTPS-only mode in your browser (if it's supported) to mitigate attacks which try to downgrade your connection from HTTPS to HTTP.</p>"},{"location":"basics/vpn-overview/#should-i-use-encrypted-dns-with-a-vpn","title":"Should I use encrypted DNS with a VPN?","text":"<p>Unless your VPN provider hosts the encrypted DNS servers themselves, probably not. Using DOH/DOT (or any other form of encrypted DNS) with third-party servers will simply add more entities to trust. Your VPN provider can still see which websites you visit based on the IP addresses and other methods. All this being said, there may be some advantages to enabling encrypted DNS in order to enable other security features in your browser, such as ECH. Browser technologies which are reliant on in-browser encrypted DNS are relatively new and not yet widespread, so whether they are relevant to you in particular is an exercise we will leave to you to research independently.</p> <p>Another common reason encrypted DNS is recommended is that it prevents DNS spoofing. However, your browser should already be checking for TLS certificates with HTTPS and warn you about it.

UDP (used by WebRTC, HTTP3/QUIC, and other protocols), ICMP, and other packets will be dropped. To compensate for this, VPN providers typically will route all non-TCP packets through their VPN server (your first hop). This is the case with ProtonVPN. Additionally, when using this Tor over VPN setup, you do not have control over other important Tor features such as Isolated Destination Address (using a different Tor circuit for every domain you visit).</p> <p>The feature should be viewed as a convenient way to access hidden services on Tor, not to stay anonymous.

These are based on blockchain technology and claim to eliminate trust in a single party by distributing the nodes across lots of different people. However, many times a dVPN will default to a single node, meaning you need to trust that node completely, just like a traditional VPN. Unlike a traditional VPN, this one node that can see all your traffic is a random person instead of your VPN provider that can be audited and has legal responsibilities to uphold their privacy policy. Multi-hop is needed to solve this, but that comes with a stability and performance cost.</p> <p>Another consideration is legal liability. The exit node will need to deal with legal problems from misuse of the network, an issue that the Tor network has contended with for its entire existence. This discourages regular people from running nodes and makes it more attractive for a malicious actor with lots of resources to host one. This is a big problem if the service is single-node, as the potentially malicious exit node can see who you are and what you're connecting to.</p> <p>Many dVPNs are used to push a cryptocurrency rather than to make the best service.

In the context of an instant messenger, for example, end-to-end encryption provides privacy by keeping your message visible only to yourself and the recipient.</p> Security <p>Security is the ability to trust the applications you use\u2014that the parties involved are who they say they are\u2014and keep those applications safe. In the context of browsing the web, for example, security can be provided by HTTPS certificates.</p> <p>Certificates prove you are talking directly to the website you're visiting, and keep attackers on your network from reading or modifying the data sent to or from the website.</p> Anonymity <p>Anonymity is the ability to act without a persistent identifier. You might achieve this online with Tor, which allows you to browse the internet with a random IP address and network connection instead of your own.</p> <p>Pseudonymity is a similar concept, but it allows you to have a persistent identifier without it being tied to your real identity.

However, if the threat you face is serious enough that you feel the need to do this, you should strongly consider not bringing a phone at all. Properly securing a disposable/burner phone is fairly challenging and may not be worth it.</p> <p>If you do buy a secondary device for this purpose, you should buy it in-person, with cash.</p> <p>Do not activate or power it on at home. The location of a phone is tracked by network carriers for at least a year at minimum, but you should assume that location history is just kept forever. Therefore, you should activate and set up the device in a very public place that is not significant to your daily life, then always keep it powered off at locations associated with you. You don't want the phone's location to ever be recorded at your home or workplace.</p> <p>If possible, you should try to purchase and set up this phone well in advance. This certainly depends on your plans, but spreading out your purchase, activation, and use of the device makes it less easy to detect. It also makes it less likely that the store you bought the phone from still has security footage of your purchase.</p> <p>You will also want to make sure you do not identify yourself when purchasing a cellular plan. This is highly dependent on your country, but many prepaid plans will not require any identification to activate. There are also some global eSIM providers which will accept payment without the need to identify yourself to them.</p> <p>One last thing: Your secondary device should still be a reasonably modern smartphone. The security measures we cover below regarding hardware and software security still apply. Smartphones are more secure against the sort of threats that activists are likely to face\u2014such as someone trying to crack into your device's data\u2014than a simple/feature/\"dumb\" phone will be. They also have many more options for secure &amp; encrypted communication methods that we'll cover below as well.</p> <p>Using a secondary device only at the protest allows you to leave your primary device powered on and at home.

Authorities are trained and known to use biometrics quickly to forcefully unlock your device, so you should be mindful of this fact when deciding what to do. If you disable biometrics, be wary of shoulder surfing attacks and prying eyes by obscuring or covering your phone whenever you unlock it.</p> <p>Whatever you do, make sure you know how to quickly shut down your phone or disable biometrics at a moment's notice. Many phones have begun replacing the standard \"hold down the power button\" function with voice assistants or other features, so practice performing the actual shutdown method beforehand to familiarize yourself.</p> <p>Modern iPhones require you to hold down the side button and either volume button before the power-off slider appears.

It seems almost all of them mention some level of privacy or encryption to entice the user to sign up for their service, but how can you be sure you\u2019re using the most secure, privacy respecting platform?</p> <p>The answer actually lies in one\u2019s threat model, which is often an ignored step in choosing all privacy related apps and services, meaning a lot of users limit their internet and communication experience because they believe they need Edward Snowden level privacy settings.</p> <p>The truth is, each user needs to decide what their privacy goals are. Is your goal to stop corporations from tracking you, targeting you, and profiting from your data? Or, are you are trying to hide communications from the government or law enforcement, which is common for journalists and activists who want to protect their sources or communications from government eyes?</p> <p>Once you understand your goals you can start to look at messengers and their upsides and downsides, and it\u2019s important to remember, there is no perfect solution. Each service, no matter how secure can be compromised, because at the end of the day, you\u2019re dealing with other humans who can screenshot, copy, or forward your messages to parties you did not intend to see them. So, it\u2019s also important to know who you are messaging, verifying their keys, and ensuring that you place the utmost trust in them with the content you are sending.</p> <p>If your goal is to simply avoid corporate tracking and the harvesting of your data from your communications, you can eliminate apps such as Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp, both services owned by Facebook and while offering encrypted messaging (optional in Messenger), Facebook reads your non-encrypted messages, and WhatsApp has fallen victim to security breaches.</p> <p>For this type of user, your options are much more wide as you may be more willing to share your email address or phone number at signup and can be less concerned with metadata (we will get to that shortly), and you want to look for a messenger that simply isn\u2019t scanning your content or behavior to sell it.</p> <p>If your goal is to evade more massive state-sponsored surveillance programs, the aforementioned apps are out of the question, but so are many others.</p> <p>This is because when it comes to these apps, and other like it, you don\u2019t own the encryption keys, the service does, so they are able to decrypt your messages, for their own use, or for the use of government officials who request it. This is something important you\u2019ll want to remember as you choose the messenger that is right for you.</p> <p>Even Apple\u2019s iMessage, which is encrypted, while more secure than Facebook\u2019s offerings, still control the keys and can access your messages if necessary. Apple does also collect data based on your behavior, so while using iMessage isn\u2019t the same as handing your data over to Facebook, you\u2019re still messaging with a variety of privacy vulnerabilities.

This includes things like email you write and receive, photos and videos you save, docs and spreadsheets you create, and comments you make on YouTube videos.</p> <p>Firstly, no matter what Google claims to do (or not do) with your data now, there isn't much preventing Google from using it for a different purpose later on.

First, the end-to-end encryption the CryptPad software utilizes uses strong and modern algorithms. When encryption like this is well implemented, it means the content of your data can never be accessed by the CryptPad instance (server) operators. In contrast, services like Google hold the decryption keys to your data at all times, placing it at risk of being misused or compromised in a data breach. With CryptPad, if a CryptPad instance that has well implemented the software experienced a data breach and your encrypted content was stolen, your content would still be protected as long as you've used a unique, complex, and long password and protected it well.</p> <p>Second, because CryptPad's code is open, what it promises can be verified. Making source code open doesn't magically make it secure, but the CryptPad software is a project that had many eyes on in GitHub, has been around for over 10 years, and is actively maintained by a team experienced with open-source software.</p> <p>Additionally, if you decide to use CryptPad's flagship instance, your data will be hosted in France. This isn't magical either, but because European Union countries are all subjected to the GDPR most have adopted stronger data privacy practices by default. While these other factors are not technical guarantees, they all serve to increase the level of trust we feel comfortable giving CryptPad's software and flagship instance.</p> <p>Finally, if you do not trust CryptPad at all, the good news is you don't have to. If you prefer to use an instance that is not run by the CryptPad team, you can look for other organizations hosting instances of CryptPad open to the public. Of course make sure to pick an instance worthy of your trust.

While CryptPad offers some of the very best protections for your privacy, you still have to take certain measures to secure your CryptPad data properly. CryptPad cannot control this part.</p> <p>Here's a few things you should remember to keep your CryptPad data secure and private:</p> <p>Trustworthy server: It's important to select a CryptPad instance that is trustworthy. Keep in mind that the instance operators could have access to your IP address or could theoretically maliciously modify the CryptPad's code they use to make it insecure.</p> <p>Safe device: Your device also needs to be safe and secure. There isn't much that any external service can do to protect your data if your device is compromised.</p> <p>IP address: Don't forget that whenever you connect to a server, website, or any service online, you are sharing your IP address, which can be used to identify and locate you, more or less accurately. If this is a threat to you, consider using a trustworthy VPN or the Tor network to protect your IP address.</p> <p>HTTPS: Make sure the CryptPad instance's address you use starts with \"HTTPS\".</p> <p>Document links: Because CryptPad includes the keys to decrypt your document in the links you use and share, anyone who can access your browsing history could potentially read your decrypted document. This is also true for anything in your browser or device that can access your browser's history (extensions, synced accounts, screen-sharing, Windows Recall, etc.). To mitigate this, you should enable the option \"Safe links\" in \"Settings\" &gt; \"Security &amp; Privacy\".</p> <p>Password: It's important to safeguard your password properly and choose a password that is unique, complex, and long. No matter how good the encryption is, if someone guesses your password, it's game over.</p> <p>Multifactor authentication: As soon as you create an account, you should enable a second factor of authentication. This will help protect your data against account takeover, in case your password were to be guessed or leaked. This is true for any account you have.</p> <p>Document accesses: Be careful to reduce the document's access to the minimum access required for functionality. For example, if you share a document link publicly, make sure it's a read-only link that doesn't allow anyone to edit it.</p> <p>File history: By default, files keep history of document changes and who viewed or modified a document. You can see this in \"File\" &gt; \"History\". If you need to erase this history for safety but keep the document, you can go to \"File\" &gt; \"Make a copy\", then go back to the original document with the history you need to erase, click on \"Access\", then \"Destroy\", then click again on \"Are you sure?\". This will permanently destroy your original document. Be careful, there is no recovery after this.</p> <p>Static keys: CryptPad uses static keys to encrypt your documents. This means that once you have shared a document, and therefore its static keys, you cannot revoke this access. By default, anyone you have shared a link to your document with will retain this access indefinitely. If you wish to revoke access, you can make a copy of the document then destroy the original. This will also erase the document's history.</p> <p>To learn more about the CryptPad team's recommendations on the most secure way to use CryptPad, you can read this article.</p>"},{"location":"blog/2025/05/01/cryptpad-review/#downsides","title":"Downsides","text":"<p>There are a few downsides in using CryptPad as your office suite.</p> <p>First, due to the nature of end-to-end encryption, it is slower. Naturally, each file needing to get decrypted before each use can slow down your workflow. The CryptPad instance you have chosen to use, your internet connection's speed, and your device's speed are all factors that can contribute in making this operation slower or faster. But remember, you are trading speed for security and privacy.</p> <p>Second, there is no mobile or desktop app available at this time. CryptPad only runs in the browser (for now). Depending on your type of usage, this can be inconvenient. Additionally, this means there is no way to access your data locally unless you create a copy of it in plain text on your device.

We found this quite remarkable as the two companies seem to have conflicting business models. Startpage has been known for basing their advertisements on what their users enter in their search bar. System1 on the other hand, is a pay-per-click advertising company that \"has developed a pre-targeting platform that identifies and unlocks consumer intent across channels including social, native, email, search, market research and lead generation rather than relying solely on what consumers enter into search boxes.\"</p> <p>We reached out to System1 CEO Ian Weingarten for an explanation. We received a very general response that did not address key questions.</p> <p>Seemingly prompted by our ongoing concerns, Startpage released a public letter addressed to us from their CEO, and hosted a Q&amp;A on their Subreddit to try and explain the situation. While some of our questions were answered, we noted that the company seemed to be evasive, essentially restating information from a previously published blog post or posting the same response to different questions. People had to really dig to get answers and puzzle all information together, instead of getting a clearly explained and comprehensive answer from the start. Requests for clarification to some important questions went ignored.</p> <p>Because of the conflicting business model and the unusual way the company reacted, claiming to be fully transparent but being evasive at the same time, we have no choice but to delist Startpage from our recommendations until it is fully transparent about its new ownership and data processing. Remaining questions include:</p> <ul> <li>The % of Startpage and Surfboard Holding B.V. (the Startpage holding company) System1 acquired in December 2018.</li> <li>The current % ownership by System1 at the time of the audit (and any other major owners).</li> <li>Information about Privacy One Group Ltd. Where is it registered and in what city, state and country does it operate? (We have not been able to verify registration information.)</li> <li>A diagram of data flows, including flows to outside organizations, like System1, Privacy One etc.</li> </ul> <p>This delisting does not necessarily mean Startpage is violating its privacy policy. We have no evidence of that. But because there are still so many unanswered questions, we can no longer recommend the service with good confidence. If Startpage aims to be re-considered, they will have to answer the questions above, preferably along with an explanation of why it took them so long to get proper answers out to the public.</p> <p>Sincerely, Blacklight447 Privacy Guides</p> <p>2020-05-03: Startpage has answered all of our questions for them and has clarified their policies. We have decided to recommend their service again, and you can read our latest announcement for more details.</p> <p>2023-10-23: This post has been edited to reflect the team's move from PrivacyTools to Privacy Guides.</p> <p>Share this page: Share on  Share on </p>","tags":["Search Engines"]},{"location":"blog/2019/11/19/delisting-wire/","title":"Delisting Wire From Privacy Guides","text":"<p>Illustration: Jonah Aragon / Privacy Guides | Photo: Unsplash</p> <p>It has recently come to the attention of the Privacy Guides team that Wire, the popular end-to-end encryption messaging platform has been sold or moved to a US company. After a week of questioning, Wire finally confirmed they had changed holding companies and would now be a US based company in a move they called \u201csimple and pragmatic,\u201d as they worked to expand their foothold in the enterprise market. This also came alongside the news that Wire had accepted more than $8 million in Venture Capital (VC) funding from Morpheus Ventures, as well as other investors.</p> <p>Morpheus Ventures holds a portfolio including companies in healthcare, voice AI, life insurance, and retail customer data analytics: All sectors that have historically used invasive data collection methods to survive. Why would a VC with a portfolio centered on consumer data want to invest in a company whose mission claims to protect that very same information?</p> <p>Earlier this year, Wire announced they had entered a partnership with FedResults, in a move that would bring Wire's secure messaging platform to US federal agencies. This raised a few eyebrows, but did not alarm the privacy community as Wire remained Swiss based and beholden to Switzerland's strict privacy laws. Today however, while much of Wire's business will continue to be run out of their Swiss offices, with new US-based ownership it is not entirely clear how much jurisdiction the United States will have over Wire data.</p> <p>This is alarming because it is well known that Wire stores unencrypted metadata for every user.</p> <p>In an interview with TechCrunch, Wire CEO Morten Br\u00f8gger said of privacy laws: \u201cWe are in Switzerland, which has the best privacy laws in the world\u201d \u2014 it\u2019s subject to Europe\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation framework (GDPR) on top of its own local laws \u2014 \u201cand Wire now belongs to a new group holding, but there no change in control.\u201d [sic]</p> <p>Even if he is correct, the move and statement do bring up further questions. With Wire now being a US company with contracts partnering it with US federal authorities, will those authorities now have leverage to compel Wire to give up metadata on users? Wire has investors to answer to and will not be able to risk losing large deals with clients like the US federal government. This is of course a hypothetical situation, but one to be considered nonetheless as we decide which services to recommend on Privacy Guides.</p> <p>Wire also quietly made an adjustment to its own privacy policy. A previous version of the policy (July 18, 2017) stated it would only share user data when required by law. Now (Updated September 1, 2018), it reads they will share user data when \"necessary.\" What does necessary mean, and necessary to whom? Necessary to law enforcement, shareholders, or advertisers? The word \"necessary\" is an alarming change because \"necessary\" is purposefully vague terminology that could conceivably be used as a tool to justify any action. This change doesn't leave the user with much confidence as to when the company may share your data.</p> <p>Yet another red flag, and one of the more important ones to us, was that Wire decided not to disclose this policy change to its users, and when asked why, Br\u00f8gger was flippant in his response, stating: \u201cOur evaluation was that this was not necessary. Was it right or wrong? I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p> <p>We feel we do know, and the answer was that it was wrong. Privacy and security are not built solely on strong technology, but on trust. Yes, we can review Wire's open source code on GitHub, but we can't ever be sure that code is the same exact code that runs on their servers in practice. Yet, we have trusted them in the past because Wire had built a trustworthy reputation for themselves. We now feel that Wire has lost this reputation. By deciding to withhold information regarding its ownership and policies from its users, Wire has broken the trust our community has placed in it, and worse yet sounds almost dismissive of the worries voiced by the privacy community that had long held them in high regard.</p> <p>Because of these ongoing concerns, and this break in trust in Wire's organization, Privacy Guides has made the decision to remove Wire from its recommendations. It is worth noting that does not necessarily mean Wire is unsafe, but we believe it is our duty to recommend products that we as a team feel comfortable standing behind. We need to believe in the security, privacy, and integrity of our recommendations, and we no longer feel we can do that with Wire at this time.</p> <p>2023-10-23: This post has been edited to reflect the team's move from PrivacyTools to Privacy Guides.</p> <p>Share this page: Share on  Share on </p>","tags":["Instant Messengers"]},{"location":"blog/2025/02/03/easyoptouts-review/","title":"EasyOptOuts Review & Real-World Test","text":"<p>EasyOptOuts.com is a $19.99/year people-search site removal service which will search a number of different data broker sites and automatically submit opt-out requests on your behalf.

Because computers can only make connections to IP addresses, it's necessary to use DNS every time you visit a new domain. But DNS is unencrypted by default, that means everyone on your network (including your ISP) can view what domains you're looking up, and in some situations even change the IP answers to redirect you to their own websites! Encrypting your DNS traffic can shield your queries and add some additional protection to your browsing.</p> <p>Encrypted DNS takes many forms: DNS over HTTPS (DoH), DNS over TLS, DNSCrypt, etc., but they all accomplish the same thing. They keep your DNS queries private from your ISP, and they make sure they aren't tampered with in transit between your DNS provider. Fortunately, Firefox recently added native DoH support to the browser. On the General page of your preferences, scroll down to and open Network Settings. At the bottom of the window you will be able to select \"Enable DNS over HTTPS\" and choose a provider.</p> <p>Keep in mind that by using DoH you're sending all your queries to a single provider, probably Cloudflare unless you choose another provider that supports DNS over HTTPS. While it may add some privacy protection from your ISP, you're only shifting that trust to the DoH provider. Make sure that's something you want to do.</p> <p>It should also be noted that even with DoH, your ISP will still be able to see what domain you're connecting to because of a technology called Server Name Indication (SNI). Until SNI is encrypted as well, there's no getting around it. Encrypted SNI (eSNI) is in the works \u2014 and can actually be enabled on Firefox today \u2014 but it only works with a few servers, mainly ones operated by Cloudflare, so its use is limited currently. Therefore, while DoH provides some additional privacy and integrity protections, its use as a privacy tool is limited until other supplemental tools like eSNI and DNSSEC are finalized and implemented.</p>","tags":["Browsers","Firefox"]},{"location":"blog/2025/05/01/firefox-privacy/#change-your-search-engine","title":"Change Your Search Engine","text":"<p>This is an easy one.

With microG, you have the option to choose between different backend location providers, including shifting trust to another location backend, like Mozilla; using DejaVu, a location backend that locally collects and saves RF-based location data to an offline database which can be used when GPS is not available; or to simply not use a network location backend at all.</p> <p>Network location providers like Play Services or Mozilla rely the on the MAC addresses of surrounding Wi-Fi access points and Bluetooth devices being submitted for location approximation. Choosing a network location like Mozilla to use with microG provides little to no privacy benefit over Google because you are still submitting the same data and trusting them to not profile you.</p> <p>Local RF location backends like DejaVu require that the phone has a working GPS first for the local RF data collected to be useful.

While the information is typically stripped of obviously identifying fields, like a user's name or phone number, it can contain everything from age and gender to a device ID. It's possible for experts to de-anonymize some of this data and connect it to real people.</p> <p>While Burrill was without a doubt in violation of his work's own code of conduct, he did decide on his own to be a priest. However, his personal life was not harming others and was just that, his personal life. While the question looms about who was tracking him to begin with and why, the fact it was so easy to do is alarming.</p> <p>What if Burrill wasn't a priest, but just happened to work for someone who held anti-homosexual views who used this data to out him, humiliate him, and fire him under false pretenses?

It is kept on a USB stick and resets itself entirely after each use (except if you enable its encrypted password-protected Persistent Storage). What is done on Tails does not leave any digital traces on the computer it is plugged into, hence \"amnesic.\"</p> <p>Additionally, Tails comes with pre-installed applications that will help increase your security and privacy online. When accessing the internet from Tails, your traffic will be automatically rerouted through the Tor network. This is a special network that makes it very difficult to identify your location or the websites you access, even from your Internet Service Provider (ISP).</p> <p>However, unless you configure the Tor bridge option to hide this, your ISP will know you have been using Tor, although they will not know which websites in particular you have visited through Tor.

Thank you for taking time off your busy schedule to talk with us.</p>"},{"location":"blog/2025/05/01/interview-with-micah-lee/#cyd-the-app-to-claw-back-your-data-from-big-tech","title":"Cyd: The app to claw back your data from Big Tech","text":"<p>Em: Let's start with your newest project. Cyd is an application you have created in 2024 to help people backing up and deleting their tweets on X-(Twitter). This app emerged from the ashes of Semiphemeral, a great tool that was unfortunately rendered unusable when Twitter decided to shut off its API. I personally loved Semiphemeral and used it to delete thousands of my tweets before eventually deleting my whole Twitter account later on. Can you tell us more about how Cyd works despite not using X's API?</p> <p>Micah:</p> <p>APIs make it way simpler for programmers to interact with online services, but they're not the only way. As long as social media platforms like X still run websites, and it's still possible for you, the human, to manually scroll through your tweets and delete them, it's possible to write a program that can do this for you.</p> <p>This is basically how Cyd works. It's a desktop app that includes an embedded web browser. When you add an X account to it, you login to your account in the browser, and then Cyd takes over. You can tell it that you want to delete your tweets, or likes, or bookmarks, or unfollow everyone, or save a backup of your DMs, or plenty of other things, and it does this by automating the embedded browser on your behalf. No API required.</p> <p>Cyd uses open APIs when they're available and make sense. For example, if you want to quit X but you don't want your old tweets to disappear forever, Cyd can migrate them to Bluesky using Bluesky's API -- soon we'll add support for migrating to Mastodon too. But for closed platforms that suck (like X, and Facebook too, which we're adding support for right now), we're forced to do it the hard way.</p> <p>Em: Talking about openness, recently this year you have decided to make Cyd open source. This is fantastic news! What did you take into consideration before making this decision and what kind of contributions or feedback are you hoping to receive from the community?</p> <p>Micah:</p> <p>I'm extremely happy that Cyd is now open source. I've open-sourced most code that I've ever written, so it honestly felt kind of weird starting out making Cyd proprietary.</p> <p>My biggest concern with making it open was that I want Cyd to be a sustainable business, where some of the features are free and some of the features are premium and cost money -- enough so that me, and eventually other people working on it, could get paid a decent wage. And as an open source app, it would be easy for someone to fork it and remove the bits of code that check if you've paid for premium access.</p> <p>But after talking it through with some other people who are very experienced open source devs, I decided that this isn't that big of a deal, and that the benefits of being open source far outweigh the costs.</p> <p>Now when you use Cyd, you can now confirm that it doesn't have access to your social media accounts or any of the data in it. Having an open issue tracker on GitHub is great too, because people in the community can open issues, post comments, and track the progress of features they're looking forward to. Also being open source means we have the ability to accept grants and donations, in addition to selling premium accounts. You can check out our Open Collective page at\u00a0https://opencollective.com/lockdown-systems.</p> <p>I'm hoping that members of the community will discuss features we're making, or even contribute code directly to our project. Right now, Cyd is only available in English, but we're also hoping to translate it into many different languages going forward, so I'm hoping that people will eventually chip in it to help translate Cyd to their native languages.</p> <p>Em: Having access to Cyd in multiple languages would really be wonderful. Likewise for multiple social media, when additional ones will be added later on. But at the moment, Cyd definitely seems to be focusing on X. You have personally been on the receiving end of Elon Musk's vengeful whims before when your Twitter account got banned in 2022 for criticizing him. I would say this qualifies as a badge of honor. Do you think you could still be on his radar with Cyd focusing on data deletion for X even though X has shut off its API? Have you taken any specific measures about this?</p> <p>Micah:</p> <p>I think it's actually more likely that I'll be on Elon Musk's radar because of my recent work with the Tesla Takedown movement than with Cyd... Right now, Musk is spending all of his time purging the US government of critics and consolidating executive power under Trump. So maybe he's too distracted on his fascism project to care about what we're doing with deleting tweets?</p> <p>But that said, Musk is litigious and we're definitely concerned about legal threats. We've consulted lawyers and we're trying to be as safe as possible.</p>"},{"location":"blog/2025/05/01/interview-with-micah-lee/#lockdown-systems-the-new-organization-developing-cyd","title":"Lockdown Systems: The new organization developing Cyd","text":"<p>Em: Cyd is a project of Lockdown Systems, a new organization you have created with colleagues just a few months ago. Can you tell us more about the structure of this organization and who else is involved?</p> <p>Micah:</p> <p>We're still finalizing the paperwork, but Lockdown Systems is a new worker-owned collective! At the moment there are five of us:</p> <ul> <li>me</li> <li>Jen, a former SecureDrop engineer who was the technical editor of my book and, for several years, my Dungeons &amp; Dragons dungeon master</li> <li>Saptak, a talented human-rights-focused open source developer who I work with on OnionShare</li> <li>Yael, an investigative journalist friend who, among other things, broke a story with me about how Zoom had lied about supporting end-to-end encryption just as everyone started using it during the pandemic</li> <li>Akil, a talented newsroom engineer I worked closely with at The Intercept</li> </ul> <p>Most companies are owned by investors who only care about profit. They don't care about the workers, and they definitely don't care about the end-users of the software they make. This is why it's so common for tech companies to end up spying on their users and selling that data: it's an additional way to make a profit for their investors.</p> <p>We're different. Lockdown Systems is owned by its workers, and we don't have outside investors. We have all agreed to the explicit goals of: ensuring the well-being of our members; making tools that help fight fascism and authoritarianism; and prioritizing impact over profit.</p> <p>We make decisions by coming to consensus, and everyone in the collective gets paid the same wage. Even though I started Cyd, I don't have more say than anyone else.</p> <p>Em: That is such a great organizational structure for software development. Lockdown Systems really has an impressive team of skilled and dedicated people. Presently, it seems from the website and GitHub page that Lockdown Systems is focusing on developing and growing Cyd only. Are you planning on using Lockdown Systems mainly for Cyd or are you envisaging other applications getting added to Lockdown Systems in the near (or far) future?</p> <p>Micah:</p> <p>So far, Cyd is our only product. There are many features we plan on building, and we also need to get it the point where it can fund our continued work. Most likely, this will be our main project for the near future.</p> <p>That said, we're definitely open to branching out. We make software that directly empowers individuals, helping them reclaim their autonomy and privacy. So if we see an opportunity to build something that will directly help people who are facing fascist threats -- whether it's supporting abortion access, keeping immigrants safe, helping communities organize mutual aid, etc. -- we will absolutely do it.</p> <p>Em: If one day some generous millionaire (let's keep it at millionaire, we all know what happens at billionaire) decided to give Lockdown Systems a huge budget bump no string attached, how would you like to grow the organization with this money?</p> <p>Micah:</p> <p>One cool thing about being a member of a collective is that if this happened, the whole collective would brainstorm together and we'd come up with ideas that are far better than what I could come up with alone. But that said, I definitely have some thoughts.</p> <p>Right now, everyone is working part time, between about 10 and 30 hours a week each. If we had the resources, many of us would work on Cyd full-time, and we'd be able to offer benefits like health care and retirement contributions. We could also increase how many people are part of the collective, and build out new features at a much faster rate.</p> <p>In my mind, future Cyd will be a single app (possible available on mobile devices, not just desktop) where you can have total control over all of your data that's currently stored by tech companies (X, Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, LinkedIn, Reddit, Bluesky, Mastodon, Discord, Slack, Telegram, Amazon, Airbnb, Substack, and on and on). You can backup all your data and then have choice over where you want the rest of it: you can delete everything, or you can choose to keep your online presence that you're proud of. You can easily cross-post to multiple platforms, and also automatically delete your older posts from the corporate platforms, while keeping them live on the open ones. Or, however else you choose to do it.</p> <p>If we had a bigger team to pay for more labor, there's a lot that we could get done.</p> <p>Em: In the meantime, I imagine one million $1 donations could also help. If our readers would like to support the development of Lockdown Systems, they can make a donation on this page.</p>"},{"location":"blog/2025/05/01/interview-with-micah-lee/#onionshare-the-app-to-share-files-host-websites-and-chat-anonymously-through-tor","title":"OnionShare: The app to share files, host websites, and chat anonymously through Tor","text":"<p>Em: Our community is likely familiar with this great application included in so many security and privacy-focused projects, including Tails, Qubes OS, Whonix, and Parrot OS. What motivated you to create OnionShare more than 10 years ago, and what do you think is the best way to use it now?</p> <p>Micah:</p> <p>I made OnionShare in 2014 while I was helping journalists report on the Snowden documents. The big motivation was a border search: Glenn Greenwald's partner, David, traveled from Berlin, where he was visiting Laura Poitras, back to his home in Rio de Janeiro. He was carrying an encrypted hard drive, on an assignment for The Guardian. During his layover at Heathrow airport in London, UK authorities detained him and searched him.</p> <p>None of this was necessary. Using the internet, encryption, and Tor, it's possible to securely move documents around the world without putting anyone at risk at a border crossing. In fact, I was already doing something similar with journalists I was collaborating with on Snowden stories myself. To send someone secret documents, I'd first encrypt them using PGP, and then place them in a folder on my laptop. I'd start up a web server with a simple directory listing for that folder, and then make that web server accessible as a Tor onion service.</p> <p>While this wasn't too hard for me, an experienced Linux nerd, to set up, it would be very challenging for most people. I made OnionShare basically as a user-friendly way for anyone to be able to securely share files, peer-to-peer, without needing to first upload them to some third party service like Dropbox.</p> <p>Today, OnionShare has more features. It's basically like a graphical interface to do cool things with Tor onion services -- you can send files, but you can also turn your laptop into an anonymous dropbox so people can upload files to you, and you can quickly host onion websites and spin up temporary chatrooms too. And there are Android and iPhone apps!</p> <p>The last time I used OnionShare myself was last week. On my personal newsletter, I'm writing a series of posts exploring the Paramilitary Leaks, 200 GB of data from the American militia movement, obtained by an infiltrator name John Williams. While working on one of my posts, John used OnionShare to send me some additional documents.</p>"},{"location":"blog/2025/05/01/interview-with-micah-lee/#other-projects-and-thoughts","title":"Other projects and thoughts","text":"<p>Em: You have been a prolific writer as a journalist for The Intercept, your own Blog, and in January 2024 you released a book called Hacks, Leaks, and Revelations: The Art of Analyzing Hacked and Leaked Data. What is this book about, and who is it written for?</p> <p>Micah:</p> <p>I spent many years reporting on hacked and leaked datasets, starting with the Snowden archive. Since then, I've seen the amount of hacked and leaked data grow exponentially. And at the same time, journalists and researchers -- the people who really need to dig through this data and find the good stories -- don't even know where to start.</p> <p>So that's what my book is, an interactive guide to downloading and exploring datasets. It doesn't require any prior knowledge, but it does get pretty technically, including two chapters teaching Python programming. If you're following along, near the beginning of the book you'll encrypt a USB hard drive and then download a copy of BlueLeaks to it -- hundreds of gigabytes of hacked police documents from the middle of the Black Lives Matter uprising in 2020. You'll use this dataset, along with several others, as examples as you learn how to make sense of data like this.</p> <p>You should definitely buy the book if you're interested and you can, but information wants to be free, so I also released the whole book under a Creative Commons license. You can read the whole thing online at hacksandleaks.com.</p> <p>Em: I can see how much of a valuable skill this is to learn for journalists and researchers in this day and age. Even if nothing compares to having a physical paper copy (in my opinion), it's wonderful that you share your book online for people who, for various reasons, cannot order a copy. You have worked or still work with the Electronic Frontier Foundation, Freedom of the Press Foundation, Science &amp; Design, the Tor Project, and Distributed Denial of Secrets. Your contribution and commitment to digital rights is undeniable. From your experience, what are you envisioning for the future of digital rights activism?</p> <p>Micah:</p> <p>I don't have all of the answers, but I do think that it's important for digital rights activists to meet the moment. Fascist politicians are gaining power around the world. The gap between the ultra rich and everyone else is wider than it's ever been before. Elon Musk has openly bought the US government, and the Trump-supporting oligarchs control all of our critical tech infrastructure. Climate change deniers and anti-vaxxers are the ones in charge right now, at least in the US. Things are pretty bad.</p> <p>Whatever we do, we should have the goal of shifting power away from the fascists and billionaires and towards everyone else. We need alternative platforms that are not only open and democratic, but also just as easy to use as the corporate walled gardens. We need digital rights, not to mention digital security, to fully integrate itself into the rest of the mass movements going on now, whether it's to save the planet from climate change, to protect immigrants getting sent to gulags, or to stop the genocide in Gaza.</p> <p>Em: Absolutely, and digital rights advocates and organizations undeniably have a crucial role to play in these movements. Finally, is there anything else you would like to share with us that we haven't discussed yet?</p> <p>Micah:</p> <p>If you want to support Lockdown Systems and you work for an organization that might be interested in offering Cyd as a benefit to their employees, check out Cyd for Teams! If we can get organizations on board this will go a long way to making sure we can continue to get paid doing this work: https://docs.cyd.social/docs/cyd-for-teams/intro</p> <p>Em: Thank you so much Micah for taking the time to answer our questions today!

The initramfs is often left unverified, unencrypted, and open up the window for an evil maid attack. The firmware on most devices is also configured to trust Microsoft's keys for Windows and its partners, leading to a large attacks surface.</p> <p>To eliminate the need to trust Microsoft's keys, follow the \"Using your own keys\" section on the Arch Wiki. The important thing that needs to be done here is to replace the OEM's key with your own Platform Key.</p> <ul> <li>If you enroll your own keys as described above, and your distribution supports Secure Boot by default, you can add your distribution's EFI Key into the list of trusted keys (db keys). It can then be enrolled into the firmware. Then, you should move all of your keys off your local storage device.</li> <li>If you enroll your own keys as described above, and your distribution does not support Secure Boot out of the box (like Arch Linux), you have to leave the keys on the disk and setup automatic signing of the kernel and bootloader. If you are using Grub, you can install it with the <code>--no-shim-lock</code> option and remove the need for the chain loader.</li> </ul> <p>The second option is creating an EFI Boot Stub that contains the kernel, initramfs, and microcode. This EFI stub can then be signed. If you use dracut this can easily be done with the <code>--uefi-stub</code> switch or the <code>uefi_stub</code> config option.

The changes to Safari include:</p> <ul> <li>JavaScript's Just-in-Time (JIT) compilation features are disabled. JIT allows JavaScript code to be compiled on the fly during its execution. Disabling JIT shows performance decreases by up to 95% in some browser benchmarks, though this difference is difficult to notice in everyday browsing. Unfortunately, the added performance and complexity of JIT in JavaScript comes with a significant security cost. An analysis conducted by Mozilla indicates that over half of Chrome exploits \"in the wild\" abused a JIT bug, so disabling JIT can roughly cut your attack surface in half.</li> <li>WebAssembly (WASM) support is also disabled. WASM was created to allow for high-performance applications on web pages; however, it can be used to fingerprint browsers to track people across websites and apps.</li> <li>JPEG 2000 support is disabled. Safari is the only modern browser to support the JPEG 2000 image format, which makes its support an easy way to identify Safari users.</li> <li>PDF previews are disabled. The PDF format has historically been subject to a number of exploits; this change means that PDF files will be downloaded and have to be opened in a dedicated PDF previewing app instead.</li> </ul> <p>Other technologies that were disabled include WebGL, MathML, Gamepad API, Web Audio API, RTCDataChannel, and SVG Fonts.

Yet, there he was proclaiming that \u201cthe future is private\u201d. If someone has to tell you that they care about your privacy, they probably don\u2019t.</p> <p>For someone trying not to appear like a cartoon villain, Zuckerberg doesn\u2019t do a great job. He gives the impression of some strange cyborg algorithmically attempting to impersonate human life. His movements are not quite robotic, but he lacks the charisma you might expect from one of the most powerful people on the planet. A New Yorker profile of him revealed that he had an affinity for Emperor Augustus, an ancient Roman tyrant. \u2018Through a really harsh approach, [Augustus] established two hundred years of world peace,\u2019 he said.</p> <p>It\u2019s the first part of that sentence that is worrying.</p> <p>Is this what Zuckerberg sees himself as: a modern-day emperor hellbent on using any means he can to gain world peace? Probably not, but it would have been reassuring if he just told us he liked doing Sudoku and dad-dancing with his daughter (interestingly named August).</p> <p>The Zuck once joked to a friend that he could get them \u2018info\u2019 about anyone in Harvard. He had email addresses, pictures, real addresses: the lot. When the friend asked how, this was his riposte: \u2018People just submitted it. I don\u2019t know why. They trust me. Dumb fucks.\u2019 We now live in a reality where Zuckerberg can get \u2018info\u2019 about almost anyone in the world.</p> <p>Like a depraved tabloid journalist fishing through a minor celebrity\u2019s trash, Facebook collects everything it can about its users. Even if it means sifting through garbage, they want that data. But Facebook is not technically in the data business. It is in what author and professor Carissa V\u00e9liz terms \u2018the business of power\u2019 \u2013 which sounds rather more sinister than flogging off mildly irritating adverts.</p> <p>V\u00e9liz argues that privacy is a form of power. It is the power to influence you, show you adverts and predict your behavior. In this sense, personal data is being used to make us do things we otherwise would not do: to buy a certain product or to vote a certain way. Filmmaker Laura Poitras described Facebook as \u2018a gift to intelligence agencies\u2019. It allows governments to arrest people planning to participate in protests before they have even begun.</p> <p>The social media giant is tip-toeing ever closer into our personal lives. When Facebook encountered competition it just bought it, adding Instagram and WhatsApp to its roster. The company even tried to make its own cryptocurrency so that one day the Facebook would control all our purchases too. Earlier this year, the project was killed by regulators. It is worth noting that when Zuckerberg purchased WhatsApp and Instagram, they had no revenue. Author Tim Wu notes in his book The Attention Merchants that Facebook is \u2018a business with an exceedingly low ratio of invention to success\u2019. Perhaps that is a part of Zuck\u2019s genius.</p> <p>\u2018Move fast and break things\u2019 was the old company motto. When there were a few too many scandals, they moved fast and rebranded to Meta. No one expected online privacy to be the \u2018thing\u2019 they broke.</p> <p>Before it became a global behemoth, Facebook started out as a dorm-room project. Zuckerberg sat at his keyboard after a few drinks and built it mainly because he could. It now has nearly three billion users. In the same way, Facebook conducted social experiments seemingly just for fun. Why he did it doesn\u2019t really matter. As John Lanchester put it: he simply did it because.</p> <p>It is unfair to say that Zuckerberg does not care about privacy \u2013 he does. That\u2019s why he spared no expense buying the houses that surrounded his home. Zuckerberg knows the power of privacy, which is painfully ironic given he has built his career on exploiting it. For Zuckerberg, at least, the future is private.

Most notably the iOS requirement for third-party browsers to use the WebKit framework built in to iOS.</p> <p>This requirement means that Onion Browser has completely separate development from Tor Browser on desktop and Android, so it can't easily make use of all the advanced privacy-protecting features the Tor Project team is constantly adding to their browser. Technically it does also mean Onion Browser has historically been immune to Firefox-related vulnerabilities, but Safari is not known for its perfect security record either, and the number of eyes on Tor-related WebKit vulnerabilities is certainly far smaller than on Firefox/Gecko-related ones.</p> <p>The Tor Project notes another drawback to Onion Browser's use of WebKit as well: The WebKit APIs simply don't give browser developers the level of control they're used to over the rendering and execution of web pages. This relates to what we saw earlier with the \"Gold\" protection levels not quite matching what you'd see in Tor Browser on other platforms.</p> <p>The EU recently required Apple to let third-party browser developers use their own engines instead of WebKit. It's possible that\u2014likely many years from now\u2014a version of Onion Browser or Tor Browser could come to iOS alongside Tor's stricter protections found in their standard browsers. Even still, the mobile version of Tor Browser on Android which does use Firefox's mobile engine is leagues behind desktop Tor Browser in terms of privacy and security.

Most notably, external web fonts are blocked in Onion Browser with Lockdown Mode enabled, just as they are in Safari. These are disabled in desktop Tor Browser's Safest mode due to both privacy concerns, and security concerns related to the font rendering engine on your device, so having the option to disable them here on iOS is very useful for those looking to maximize their security.</p> External fonts and JavaScript disabled with Gold + Lockdown Mode <p>However, enabling Lockdown Mode is detectable by websites, meaning it could potentially be used to fingerprint you.

We immediately began to consider multiple options for the future of this project, including forming our own non-profit or finding another fiscal host.</p> <p>We're excited to announce a partnership with MAGIC Grants, a Public 501(c)(3) charity with the mission of supporting privacy projects like ours and providing undergraduate scholarships for students interested in cryptocurrencies and privacy. They will immediately take over all the operations previously provided by OCF, including accepting donations on our behalf, handling any of our accounting and taxes, reimbursing team members and volunteers, and taking legal ownership of assets like our domains and servers.</p> <p>This last point is important, because we want to ensure Privacy Guides is never fully reliant on a single individual like myself. This setup ensures Privacy Guides never strays from its mission of providing free and accessible privacy and security resources to protect consumers.</p> <p>Of course, all of our projects including the open-source Privacy Guides website, our communities, and this blog remain editorially independent and volunteer led. This partnership only affects our administrative platform behind the scenes.</p> <p>MAGIC Grants was the right choice for our project for a number of reasons:</p> <ol> <li>They are a 501(c)(3) non-profit, which allows us to retain our tax-deductible status in the United States, and means there are legal safeguards in place to prevent Privacy Guides from being used for personal profit.</li> <li>They've provided us with a great deal of flexibility and independence over how we run our project, and added many safeguards to ensure the current Privacy Guides team retains ultimate control over the project. This means that nothing about Privacy Guides will change, now or in the future, due to outside influence.</li> <li>They've generously offered to provide their services to us for no fee, in support of our shared core mission of creating great educational materials.</li> </ol> <p>Finally, unlike OCF, MAGIC Grants is extremely flexible when it comes to accepting cryptocurrencies. Previously we have not been able to accept cryptocurrency donations, because OCF did not have the accounting tools in place to handle such transactions. MAGIC Grants is highly experienced in the cryptocurrency\u2014and especially Monero\u2014space, and we will be able to accept completely private donations through that very soon.</p> <p>Donations to Privacy Guides are considered restricted contributions which may only be used under the Privacy Guides Fund agreement we have with MAGIC Grants, and not for any of MAGIC Grants\u2019 other endeavors. You can make a general donation to MAGIC Grants on their website.</p> <p>We considered forming our own organization, but estimated that the initial costs to do so would meet or exceed our current annual budget, which wasn't financially viable. We have reserved the right to spin off as an independent non-profit, or to transfer to another fiscal host in the future, if we feel it would be beneficial to do so.</p> <p>Running this network of websites and services for free to the public is a time-consuming and costly endeavor. We do it because we believe it is the right thing to do, not because we are looking to make a profit. Any contributions have been either used to pay our expenses or saved in a reserve for expansion or times of need.</p> <p>Your support of this project will help us keep our servers running and pay for other various expenses accrued by the team while developing this community. We do not operate Privacy Guides for personal profit, and all funds will be used to further our mission in one form or another.</p> <p>If you like what we do, please consider contributing to our project at https://www.privacyguides.org/en/about/donate/.</p> <p>Read more about the Privacy Guides Fund announcement on MAGIC Grants' blog.</p> <p>Share this page: Share on  Share on </p>"},{"location":"blog/2025/05/01/privacy-is-not-dead/","title":"No, Privacy is Not Dead: Beware the All-or-Nothing Mindset","text":"<p>Photo: Markus Spiske / Pexels</p> <p>In my work as a privacy advocate, I regularly encounter two types of discourse that I find very damaging to privacy as a whole. The first one is the idea that privacy is dead, implying it's not worth putting any effort to protect personal data anymore. This is the abdication mindset. This attitude is the one that scares me the most because without giving it a fight then of course the battle is lost in advance. Like a self-fulfilling prophecy, privacy is dead if you let it die.</p> <p>All human rights have seen advancements and improvements in history through long battles and hard-earned victories. There needs to be people willing to fight in order to win the fight. Losing a human right is easy. Protecting a human right always requires lots of effort.</p> <p>The second mindset I want to bring up might seem like the diametric opposite, but in fact often leads to the same outcome overtime, and feeds the aforementioned. It's the mindset assuming that for anything to have value in data privacy it needs to be 100% perfectly private and secure.</p> <p>While it's true we should strive to build better privacy-focused tools and practices every day, it's extremely important to keep an open mind and a nuanced approach in data privacy.</p> <p>Now to be precise, I'm absolutely not talking about criticisms of false claims and snake oil. There's a lot of snake oil in data privacy and every misleading information and gimmick product should be exposed and severely condemned publicly.</p> <p>What I'm talking about here is different. I'm referring to the idea that if a good product/tool/practice isn't perfect it isn't worth using it. This mindset is missing such an important point. The point isn't to make privacy perfect. The point here is to reduce harm and improve privacy by small increments at a pace that is realistically sustainable for an average person.</p> <p>Here's a concrete example: Let's say your friend just told you they moved their communications from SMS to Signal. This is something to celebrate! Your friend just improved their data privacy a lot by deciding to start using Signal instead of SMS. It is absolutely not the time to tell your friend things like \"Okay, but you're not even using Firefox!\" Cherish the win, encourage your friend to embrace Signal and appreciate the new protections it offers. Once your friend is comfortable with Signal, then you can slowly bring a new idea: \"Hey Friend! I'm so glad we can communicate with Signal now, this is wonderful! I'd love to introduce you to this new browser now, I think you'd like it too!\"</p> <p>Help people move slowly but surely in the right direction, at their own pace, and with lots of positive reinforcements.</p> <p>Another example of the same issue: Let's say someone posts on social media they just discovered (or recommend) this great PrivacyProduct\u2122\ufe0f and love it! This is fantastic! This person just improved their privacy by starting to use a tool (or recommending a tool) that is more private than the previous one. Again, this is something to celebrate. It is absolutely not the time to reply something like \"But this PrivacyProduct\u2122\ufe0f logs your IP! Maybe it's end-to-end encrypted, but they log your IP! You should instead use this OtherPrivacyProduct\u2122\ufe0f that is much less usable, has none of the features you need, and you will definitely hate it, but it's so much more private!\"</p> <p>When someone replies things like that, it only has the effect of discouraging people from adopting new tools that improve their privacy. This sort of reply makes them want to stop sharing their enthusiasm about data privacy and go back to their old ways. Even worse, this often has the effect of planting doubt in the minds of everyone else around who were also thinking about migrating from BigTechProduct\u2122\ufe0f to the better PrivacyProduct\u2122\ufe0f. This doubt brings inertia, and with inertia they will just stay with BigTechProduct\u2122\ufe0f, and their privacy is now much worse for it.</p> <p>I understand that we are all very passionate about data privacy and would love others to move so much faster to meet us here. But our impatience can sometimes create more damage to the cause. It is critical to push hard for privacy rights and practices with governments and organizations. Yes, push hard there, be relentless. Institutions only listen to the people when the people scream. But with individuals, when someone shares their excitement for data privacy, when someone shares their PrivacyProduct\u2122\ufe0f recommendation that, even if imperfect, is still a great tool without misleading information, then we should all celebrate and support this.</p> <p>Privacy isn't just about the tools we use. Privacy is a culture we need to build. Cultures come with mindsets and customs. I would love to see the privacy community thrive and celebrate together every win we get. Tolerate imperfection and treasure improvement. Every little step on the path to better privacy rights and better privacy practices is a win.</p> <p>Celebrate and cheer loudly each little privacy win. This is how we all win.</p> <p>Share this page: Share on  Share on </p>"},{"location":"blog/2025/05/01/privacy-means-safety/","title":"Privacy Means Safety","text":"<p>Photo: Georgy Rudakov / Unsplash</p> <p>Privacy is a human right that should be granted to everyone, no matter the reason.

Targeted harassment can have devastating consequences ranging from silencing their victims, to suicide, to death by swatting attack.</p> <p>A well-known example of targeted harassment is Gamergate.

Furthermore, Proton Wallet doesn't support the few privacy-enhancing additions to Bitcoin that do exist, like CoinJoin or even the Lightning Network. While these technologies still don't bring Bitcoin close to the levels of privacy attainable with some alternatives like Monero, to see them lacking in a product from a privacy-centric company like Proton is extremely disappointing.</p> <p>Proton has claimed in a few interviews that they chose Bitcoin because of its mass appeal, and it's certainly true that Bitcoin has the mind share and market share to beat out any other cryptocurrency, but the most popular option isn't always the best option.</p> <p>Had Proton Wallet added support for Monero or a similarly private cryptocurrency, they could have single-handedly boosted a financial system that is actually private by default by a significant degree.

You can also optionally set a passphrase to secure your account. Note that this isn't merely a passphrase securing your account on Proton's servers beyond your usual account credentials, it's a BIP39 extension word, meaning that if you lose it your wallet will be completely unrecoverable, even if you back up your 12 word seed phrase.</p> <p></p> <p>The default currency here isn't the currency being stored in Proton Wallet. It is just used to show you the current conversion rate between Bitcoin and your local currency.</p> <p>Once you're in, Proton Wallet is fairly straightforward. In fact, there's not much to explore beyond finding your wallet address and buying Bitcoin. Clicking the Receive button brings up a panel which shows your address and allows you to generate a new one on the fly. When you generate a new address, all of your previous addresses will continue to work, but are no longer displayed anywhere.</p> <p></p> <p>Buying Bitcoin is simple as well. Proton is working with two providers, Banxa and Ramp, and if you're in the United States like I am both are available, so you can choose the one with the best exchange rate to go with. Before you purchase, Proton Wallet asks you for your current country, so that will determine which providers it's possible to use.</p> <p>There's no private payment methods though, you're stuck with credit card, Google Pay, or Apple Pay. The purchase experience isn't quite seamless either, as it redirects you to either banxa.com or ramp.network to perform the actual transaction.

Opening your wallet settings lets you enable Proton's Receive Bitcoin via Email feature, which allows other Proton Wallet users to send Bitcoin to your account with just your Proton Mail address.</p> <p></p> <p>If you have multiple addresses on your Proton account, such as aliases or addresses on a custom domain, only one address can be linked to your wallet. This can be a bit annoying for people who have given out different Proton addresses to others in the past, like if you gave out your @protonmail.com address to some people, before later migrating to @proton.me when that domain became available.</p> <p>On the other hand, if you have aliases for different projects, this is a great way to keep Bitcoin payments to each address separate. If you have your personal email and a business alias for example, you can link your personal email to your primary wallet and create a second wallet to link your business alias to, thus keeping your personal and business transactions separate.</p> <p>Proton says that you can \"create as many wallets as your Proton Wallet plan allows,\" but the exact limits are not very clear at the moment. This may become clearer as Proton Wallet exits its beta status.</p> <p>Sending Bitcoin to an email address is as simple as it is in mainstream payment apps like Venmo or CashApp, which is great. You can even include a memo with your transaction, and the transaction appears on the recipient's side very quickly. However, it can take a few hours or more for a transaction to actually complete and be usable by the recipient, so all they'll be able to do is monitor its progress in the meantime. This can be sped up by choosing a higher \"network fee\" when sending the payment, which costs more Bitcoin as the name would suggest.</p> <p>I'm not convinced this is particularly revolutionary though. Many Bitcoin wallets have streamlined the process of exchanging address information with other people with methods like QR codes, which are likely going to be more widely used than email in today's mobile-first world. Being able to replace Bitcoin addresses with emails fairly seamlessly is nice, but is it nice enough to warrant the entire Proton Wallet product?

When it launched in 2014, Proton Mail was revolutionary in the email space. Encrypted email providers already existed, but Proton offered something different: Proton brought a good user experience to an interoperable encryption standard, PGP. While everyone else in the email space was rolling their own password-protected web portals to secure messages or simply delivering emails in plaintext, Proton built a user-friendly platform that actually improved the email ecosystem at large in the process.</p> <p>Proton's leadership thinks they can do for cryptocurrency what they once did for email, but there's a clear difference between then and now. Proton Mail had privacy and security ready to go from the beginning, but Proton Wallet simply meets the status quo.</p>","tags":["Cryptocurrency"]},{"location":"blog/2025/05/01/proton-wallet-review/#why-does-this-exist","title":"Why does this exist?","text":"<p>Proton Wallet is in a strange position. I've spoken to a few sources who suggest that privacy features like CoinJoin, which can mix Bitcoin in order to better anonymize transactions, were intended to be included at launch. The crackdown on the ill-fated Samouri Wallet project by U.S. authorities last April certainly put a damper on privacy in the Bitcoin space, and likely made Proton wary of introducing such features to the public.</p> <p>Proton suggests this themselves, stating on their website:</p> <p>Coinjoin is considered the best solution for improving blockchain privacy. It works by mixing your BTC with other users\u2019 BTC in a collaborative self-custodial transaction where you get back the same amount of BTC that you put in but on a different address that cannot be easily linked to your previous address. However, in 2024, in what many consider to be a regulatory overreach and attack on privacy, some of these Coinjoin services have been declared illegal in the US and EU. The future of financial privacy may therefore be decided by ongoing litigation in the next decade and privacy advocates should support these efforts.</p> <p>This situation likely soured Proton on other privacy-friendly cryptocurrencies like Monero as well. I get it, financial privacy is an extremely challenging task for any company to take on. We can't expect Proton to take on the risk of offering a completely anonymous payment service in the current legal climate, but it begs the question: why enter the financial space at all?</p> <p>Proton Wallet seems like a product that doesn't know its own place in the world. Is it meant to save us from the tyranny of payment processors like PayPal who can freeze your funds at a whim? Proton certainly thinks so, having faced that exact problem themselves during their original 2014 crowdfunding campaign. But in that case, is Bitcoin the actual solution to this problem, or is it just a stopgap fix that Proton happened to latch on to way back in 2014 when Bitcoin was more in vogue and there were few competitors?</p> <p>Today, there are many alternatives to Bitcoin which are safer to store your money in while remaining protected from intrusive fintech companies like PayPal. Stablecoins like USDC can be traded on multiple cryptocurrency networks without the need for middlemen payment processors, and can be exchanged at a variety of exchanges with the huge benefit of having significantly less risk than Bitcoin, theoretically no risk at all. Support for USDC or a similar technology would go a long way towards enabling usable cryptocurrency transactions for everyday users, even though USDC doesn't have any additional privacy protections either.</p> <p>Or, was Bitcoin chosen to give us independence from fiat currency, including stablecoins, entirely? Maybe so, but is that something we actually want? Prepping for a worldwide market collapse is perhaps a bit of a fool's errand. If the US Dollar and other economies failed overnight, I think we would all have a lot more problems than Bitcoin is going to solve for us. Bitcoin is a poor store of value to serve as an alternative to traditional currency anyway. Any asset which can gain or lose half its purchasing power on any given day of the week simply can't function as a viable medium of exchange, meaning it's virtually useless for day-to-day transactions.</p> <p>However, if Proton Wallet wasn't meant for all that, if it was simply meant to bring privacy to Bitcoin, then it's certainly a failure. Proton hasn't taken any risks with this product, meaning it's really only good for satisfying a singular belief: That Bitcoin is just inherently good, and anything to promote Bitcoin is inherently good as well. I don't share these fanatical beliefs of Bitcoin maximalists, however, when Bitcoin is demonstrably lacking in a wide variety of ways.</p>","tags":["Cryptocurrency"]},{"location":"blog/2025/05/01/proton-wallet-review/#conclusion","title":"Conclusion","text":"<p>Personally, I'm a bit of a cryptocurrency pessimist in general, but I can see some appeal for the technology in very specific areas. Unfortunately, Proton Wallet doesn't seem to fit in to a useful niche in any meaningful way. The functionality it does support is extremely basic, even by Bitcoin standards, and it simply doesn't provide enough value over the existing marketplace.</p> <p>If you're an existing Proton user simply looking for a place to store some Bitcoin you already have sitting around, Proton Wallet might be perfectly adequate. For everyone else, I don't see this product being too useful. Bitcoin is still far too volatile to be a solid investment or used as a safe store of value if you crave financial independence and sovereignty, and Proton Wallet simply isn't adequate for paying for things privately online.</p> <p>There is some potential with Proton Wallet. Personally, I would like to see support for Monero, a cryptocurrency that has privacy features built-in by default. There is also the possibility of Proton expanding into the traditional finance space with features like a digital wallet for credit/debit cards, card aliasing \u00e0 la privacy.com, and tap to pay within their mobile apps. A third-party alternative to Apple Pay and Google Wallet, and for the first time ever such a product could actually be viable: It's always been possible on Android, but just last month Apple announced the possibility for iOS developers to use NFC to facilitate payments outside of Apple Wallet.

From their perspective nothing fundamental had changed due to the acquisition, except that they would now have the resources to market Startpage efficiently thanks to System1. Unfortunately, Startpage failed to put themselves in the place of their users, and understand that their lack of transparency at the beginning would erode the trust they shared with the privacy community.</p> <p>By December, Startpage had responded to our questions. More recently they also clarified that System1's privacy policy does not relate to Startpage; Startpage's privacy policy remains unchanged:</p> <p>Having a new shareholder in the company will not change any aspect of the privacy we offer.

However, once a targeted company is identified, the powers the White House then gains to prevent their operation and access within the United States are wildly expansive.</p>","tags":["Government","VPN","United States"]},{"location":"blog/2025/05/01/restrict-act/#how-might-this-affect-vpn-providers","title":"How might this affect VPN providers?","text":"<p>This is the question on a lot of people's mind, and the answer is of course a bit complicated.</p> <p>Right now, this bill is mainly focused on TikTok, despite them not being mentioned specifically within the bill text, so let's focus on them. If the White House determines that TikTok is covered by this act, they could implement \"mitigation measures\" including ordering Internet Service Providers to block access to TikTok entirely. At this point, the Act grants very broad power to block circumvention of those mitigation measures as well. Now, any service \"which is designed or intended to evade or circumvent the application of this Act\" falls under the scope of this regulation.</p> <p>No person may cause or aid, abet, counsel, command, induce, procure, permit, or approve the doing of any act prohibited by, or the omission of any act required by any regulation, order, direction, mitigation measure, prohibition, or other authorization or directive issued under, this Act. (Section 11(a)(2))</p> <p>A reading of this could certainly include VPN providers. Even if the White House does not declare VPN companies to be directly violating this act, they could certainly deem their services to be aiding and abetting violators, and the end result is the same: Regulations which ban the operation of VPNs entirely.</p> <p>Even more worryingly\u2014especially for myself at Privacy Guides\u2014a stricter reading of the quoted section above could make it illegal to even share advice (i.e. \"counsel\") on how to run a VPN or sideload TikTok! And all of these violations can be punished with criminal charges including up to 20 years in jail or up to $1,000,000 in fines.</p> <p>So what do we actually know?</p> <ul> <li>Does this bill ban VPNs? No.</li> <li>Does this bill give the White House executive power to ban VPNs? Yes!</li> </ul> <p>Ultimately, the provisions in this bill are so broad that it is inconceivable that they will not be eventually abused by the White House, it would only be a matter of time. Any law like this which gives the government broad authority to ban all sorts of tools if they are even tangentially related to a foreign country they deem a threat is simply unacceptable in a purportedly free country, and we need to make sure it does not pass.</p>","tags":["Government","VPN","United States"]},{"location":"blog/2025/05/01/restrict-act/#is-this-good-privacy-regulation","title":"Is this good privacy regulation?","text":"<p>Absolutely not.

People will often criticize a product or service as \u201cnot private\u201d when they really mean \u201cnot anonymous.\u201d Privacy, security, and anonymity often complement each other, but they are not always dependent on each other, and they are definitely not the same thing. A service can be private without being anonymous, or even secure without being private. Which one should you prioritize? To some extent, there are no wrong answers. It really comes down to your threat model and what your desired goal is. It is perfectly fine to pick a product that provides privacy even though it doesn't provide anonymity. Furthermore, it's okay to pick a product that doesn't provide security if it does provide one of the other features. The important thing is that you need to be aware what these products and services are and aren\u2019t offering you so that you can use them correctly.</p> <p>There\u2019s lots of ways to define privacy, security, and anonymity. Someone showed me this definition and I really liked it. It seems to pretty much hit the nail on the head when applying these terms specifically to data privacy and cybersecurity:</p> <p>Anonymity: The sender and/or recipient's real ID is unknown</p> <p>In the real world this could be a secret admirer sending a Valentine's Day card. Online this could be when ones \"footprints\" cannot lead back to the poster: e.g. Tor.</p> <p>Privacy: The contents of the message can only be seen/heard by the intended recipient(s)</p> <p>In the real world this could be a whispered conversation between two people in the middle of Siberia. Online this could be a Signal message, which is end-to-end encrypted and only the recipient &amp; sender can read the contents.</p> <p>Security (in the context of privacy/anonymity): The parties involved are who they say they are</p> <p>In the real world this could be something unique and verifiable such as a passport or fingerprints. Online this could be certificates or PGP signatures.</p> <p>These topics often overlap: Privacy can help your security because if people don't know information about you, they can't effectively target you. For example, an attacker that doesn't know who you bank with cannot know which bank to target. Security can protect your privacy by forcibly controlling who has access to that information about you.

A secure product does not guarantee privacy, a private product does not guarantee security, and anonymity does not guarantee either. As I said before, there is nothing wrong with valuing one facet over another.  It's also okay to use Signal even though it doesn't give you total anonymity. Just be sure you understand how a product is meant to be used and where it both shines and falls short. It would be awful to use Google thinking that it will give your communications total privacy and then your financial details get stolen by a rogue employee. Or if you used a service like Signal to organize protests in a hostile country only to be arrested once your phone number is unmasked. Know the limitations of the services you choose and decide what features are important to you. It\u2019s also important to know that privacy and security are sliding scales. This could be an entire blog post on its own. Think of passwords. Any password \u2013 even \u201cpassword\u201d - is technically more secure than no password at all. But a 16-character randomly-generated password is even more secure than \u201cpassword.\u201d Sometimes it\u2019s okay to find a solution that offers a blend \u2013 less privacy in one area in exchange for more security in another, or vice versa.

This means that most organizations operating worldwide, regardless of where they are located in the world, must comply with the GDPR.</p> <p>As is often the case with data privacy laws, it took a few years before Data Subjects (your legal designation under the GDPR) noticed any concrete changes.

This and similar rights have existed before, but through the GDPR and its enforcement it has affected technology in a much broader and impactful way.</p> <p>Slowly since 2018, applications requiring accounts have started to implement data deletion and account deletion features within the account itself. A probable reason for this is that due to the GDPR, and a now growing number of privacy regulations from various states in the United States, organizations are obligated to respond to Data Subject requests to get their personal data deleted. Managing this can be quite cumbersome for organizations. The burden of answering and implementing each data deletion request manually is often not worth the value of the data itself. Organizations with enough resources have simply added it as an internal product feature. This makes data deletion requests manageable by each Data Subject themselves (at least partially), freeing the organization from legally having to answer each individual request. When implemented properly, this is what we can call a win-win situation.</p> <p>Request to delete</p> <p>Unfortunately, not all applications have integrated automatic deletion features internally (yet).

Websites, social media accounts, and other platforms are constantly popping up out of nowhere, telling you to buy The Greatest Service Ever in order to solve all your privacy woes, whatever that may be. These websites often employ marketing teams to make sure their \u201creviews\u201d are what you see first when you begin your research. Some of them are even operated by VPN providers themselves, operating under anonymous business entities to hide their bias, or doing it right out in the open, hoping you\u2019ll mistake their advertising-filled press releases and blogs as insider knowledge of the VPN space.</p> <p>When a seemingly \u201cunbiased review\u201d on a site is merely a paid advertisement in disguise, that website is breaking their reader\u2019s trust. From a consumer\u2019s point of view, affiliate marketing and other paid promotional techniques like this make it near impossible to know when a review is genuine or not.</p> <p>This isn\u2019t going to be a lengthy blog post on advertising being bad, far from it. In fact, many of the VPN providers we recommend on Privacy Guides engage in responsible advertising across various platforms. The key is transparency: Their advertisements should look like advertisements, and nothing else.</p> <p>I\u2019m really looking to take the time here and identify \u201cthe bad\u201d sites and resources that use these techniques to profit off a community just looking for reliable answers. Lots of sites like these will claim they\u2019re acting in your best interest, but they\u2019re just here to make money.</p> <p>One common thing I\u2019ll see on these sites is a ranked list of providers that are ostensibly the best ones to choose from. These sites have supposedly done all the work for you, so you can just click and go, assured you\u2019re making the right choices.</p> <p>So here\u2019s my issue with ranking VPN providers: Let\u2019s face it, VPN providers are all offering the same service, and they will either protect your information or they won\u2019t. Ranking providers like this only serves as an easy way to guide users to a certain choice (in this case, the choice that will make the reviewers the most money).</p> <p>Let\u2019s look at one of these \u201creview\u201d sites for example, which will go unnamed for the purposes of this article. On their homepage they prominently list 10 providers as the \u201cbest\u201d VPN services, in this order:</p> <ol> <li>NordVPN</li> <li>Surfshark</li> <li>ExpressVPN</li> <li>PerfectPrivacy</li> <li>IPVanish</li> <li>Mullvad</li> <li>CyberGhost</li> <li>Trust.Zone</li> <li>ibVPN</li> <li>Private Internet Access</li> </ol> <p>To their credit, this review site also helpfully included an advertising disclosure in their footer. On this fairly well hidden away page, they note that they participate in affiliate programs from 8 providers, as follows:</p> <ul> <li>NordVPN</li> <li>SurfShark</li> <li>ExpressVPN</li> <li>Perfect-Privacy</li> <li>IPVanish</li> <li>CyberGhost</li> <li>Trust.Zone</li> <li>Private Internet Access</li> </ul> <p>Hmm. Look familiar? Of the 73 providers this site had reviewed at the time of writing this article, all eight of the VPN providers paying this review site happened to make their top 10 recommendations. In fact, you\u2019d have to scroll down to #6 before you found a provider that wouldn\u2019t pay them, practically buried.</p> <p>Furthermore, their list includes NordVPN, a company notable for not disclosing security breaches in a timely fashion, and ExpressVPN, a provider notable for using weak 1024-bit encryption keys to protect their users. By any objective standard, these providers do not deserve to be included in a top 10 recommendations list for securing anybody\u2019s information. This review site in particular claims to have set criteria for their recommendations, but this just demonstrates that any criteria can be adjusted to fit any goal you may have.</p> <p>If these sites truly wanted to be helpful, they would consolidate all the relevant information and present it to their users without making the choice for them. A provider is going to be better or worse for every user depending on their particular situation, and encouraging making an informed choice between options presented equally is far more beneficial to putting one over the other in a largely arbitrary fashion.</p> <p>But that isn\u2019t to say they should just throw all the providers in a big table and call it a day. Almost worse than the ranking scheme above is when sites provide out of context lists of providers, often just with pricing and a link. Sometimes they will link you to a full review (more on that in a bit), but for the most part these sites just expect you to follow their recommendations blindly.</p> <p></p> <p>These read like advertisements, because they usually are. Once again we see the usual suspects \u2014 NordVPN, ExpressVPN\u2026 \u2014 paraded as the gold standard in the VPN space, not out of any inherent value, but based on the value of their affiliate programs. To further this point, let\u2019s take a look at how much each of the five providers above will pay you for a referral (on a one-month plan).</p> <ol> <li>ExpressVPN: $13 for first month</li> <li>NordVPN: $11.95 for first month</li> <li>VPNArea: $4.95 for first month</li> <li>VPN.ac: $2.90 for first month</li> </ol> <p>Unfortunately, Perfect Privacy would not share their commission rates publicly, but if anyone has any information on that I\u2019d be happy to receive it. What I will say is that based on the information above, I would not be surprised if it fell right between ExpressVPN and NordVPN\u2019s rates. Their one-month plan costs $12.99, so assuming a 100% match on the first month (the standard from NordVPN and ExpressVPN) that would add up quite nicely.</p> <p>Once again, we see a lineup of providers ordered in a way that conveniently pays the most to the website owner. And therein lies the issue with affiliate programs. Once you begin receiving financial compensation on a per-signup basis, you are now motivated to push the most users to the sites that pay more on a monthly basis, rather than the sites that will actually help the user.</p> <p>Occasionally, these recommendations are coupled with a \u201creview\u201d that is supposedly independent and unbiased, but in reality are simply more marketing tools to persuade you towards their opinions. In most cases, these reviewers will simply copy the VPN provider\u2019s own press releases and even media, presenting their advertising as fact to their readers. These reviews are always hidden away as well, with main navigation links directing users towards the more affiliate-link-laden lists and tables that they\u2019d much rather you browse. The true value of these review articles is the Search Engine Optimization (SEO) advantage they bring in the rankings on Google, and not much more. More traffic = More clicks, at the expense of good, independent content and integrity.</p> <p>Originally, this article contained a section about how \u2018ThatOnePrivacySite\u2019 was the last bastion of a hope in the VPN review world. However, that has since sold out to \u2018Safety Detectives\u2019, a site guilty of using all the affiliate tricks mentioned above. Goes to show, eh?</p> <p>At Privacy Guides, we\u2019ve developed a set list of criteria, and we make that abundantly clear when you read our list of recommended VPN providers. We also refrain from using affiliate links. As we\u2019ve discussed, they are fundamentally flawed ways to market a service, and using them would break the trust our community has in our recommendations.</p> <p>We do have a sponsorship program, but all of our finances are handled in an incredibly transparent fashion. As a non-profit organization, the funding we receive cannot be used for private profit, and our community can see both where we receive money from and how it is being spent thanks to Open Collective.  Additionally, the recommendations on our site are handled by an entirely separate team of editors and contributors than the administrative team such as myself that handles the sponsorships and finances. The editors have sole control over our recommendations and operate entirely independently and on a volunteer-basis to ensure the choices we make are for the benefit of the privacy community over one individual.</p> <p>Ultimately, as a matter of policy our sponsors have no say over our recommendations, or whether they are recommended or a competitor is removed. We have given our community vast access to our website and internal workings to keep us in check and ensure we\u2019re staying true to our word. This separation of management and editors is a strategy that has served the media industry well for decades, and makes all of our team and organization a more credible and trustworthy source of information.</p>","tags":["VPN"]},{"location":"blog/2025/05/01/the-trouble-with-vpn-and-privacy-review-sites/#summary","title":"Summary","text":"<p>We have a lot of points we want to get across. The current landscape of privacy reviewers and \u201cexperts\u201d weighing in on topics regarding the very companies that pay for their reviews is morally reprehensible, and just another way for big tech companies to collect all of our data more easily.</p> <p>Review sites should make it abundantly clear when their reviews are paid for by the VPN companies in any fashion, whether that be via affiliate programs or good old-fashioned sponsorships. This can\u2019t be via a hidden-away disclosure in the footer or not published at all, but clear and close in proximity to the claims published on their site. Customers are not expecting or seeking out these disclosures when they visit review sites, and can\u2019t be expected to immediately discern whether you\u2019re speaking from a place of unbiased fact, or from a place with the greatest financial incentive. Better yet, they should reconsider their entire business model. Our site is based solely on a community donation model that still keeps us sustained. It\u2019s the more difficult way to build a site to be sure, actually working to gain the trust of a huge community, but the difference in quality and integrity is remarkable.</p> <p>VPN providers should consider spending less money on paid reviews, and more money on securing and validating their infrastructure. Regular security audits are one fantastic way for companies to demonstrate their dedication to keeping their users secure. We strongly believe VPN services should consider our criteria, especially in regard to the ownership of their organization. Your VPN provider should not be hiding away in Panama controlled by anonymous leadership. While you as a user deserve privacy, transparency should be required of providers if you are expected to trust them. I would not give my money to some anonymous overseas investor, why would I give all of my internet traffic to some anonymous overseas administrator?</p> <p>Finally, when you\u2019re choosing a VPN provider, do your own research.  Understand what a VPN actually does for you.  Understand what it is a security audit proves, find out who owns and operates the VPN service you want to use, and make sure their policies and technologies reflect your values.  Ultimately gathering the information yourself and making an informed decision is the only way to make sure your privacy is being respected.</p> <p>Share this page: Share on  Share on </p>","tags":["VPN"]},{"location":"blog/2025/05/01/threads-launch-twitter/","title":"Threads Is the Perfect Twitter Alternative, Just Not for You","text":"<p>Silicon Valley could well be built on the principle of scrapping principles. Now Elon Musk, perhaps the ultimate tech bro, is shredding another well-regarded convention with an original business strategy.</p> <p>Generally, in business, it is sensible to provide your customers with what they want. With Twitter, the meme-makers' favorite billionaire is doing the opposite. The cyber-trucker is trying his best to cull his customer base. Instead of finding gaps in the market, Musk is helping to create them. Ever the copycat, Mark Zuckerberg wants to give these innovative tactics a try. Enter the-company formerly-known-as-Facebook's rival to the birdsite: Threads.</p> <p>The Zuck is, by all accounts, good at making social media platforms. This doesn't mean the platforms themselves are good - they aren't. But they are unarguably successful: Instagram and WhatsApp have comfortably over a billion users, Facebook has nearly three. If only half of these users adopt the new platform, it would instantly eclipse Twitter. As it happens, Threads allows you to import all your followers from Instagram. Of all the Twitter alternatives, Zuckerberg's looks like the most promising.</p> <p>Here, however, the promise ends.</p> <p>The man behind Facebook has somehow managed to make the Twitter experience worse. Following people, a key part of the social media mogul's earlier ventures, is meaningless on Threads. You are beholden to its algorithm and who it reckons you will interact with. (Want to see what your mates are posting about? Tough, here's an 'Epic Meme from the official Salesforce account.') Your timeline isn't chronological either.</p> <p>And this is where it gets clever. Say you tire of blue-tick brands shitposting, and want to delete your account? Hard luck. Like an ill-advised tattoo, Threads accounts are effectively permanent. If you delete your Threads account, your Instagram account goes too. You're locked in this shiny pit of brand based flimflam, and your Instagram account is hostage.</p> <p>Threads is what would happen if Twitter and Instagram made out in a bowling alley. It's all their worst parts combined - but it may well succeed. Rocket-man Musk's changes to Twitter have not exactly made it 'brand friendly'. Threads, meanwhile, is shaping up to be a paradise for in-your-face brands - and the AdTech industry would love for you to join them. As Chris Black put it, Threads is just 'another marketing channel masquerading as a community.' When the site inevitably introduces ads, the scared Twitter advertisers will flock. A TechCrunch headline ran 'You can\u2019t post ass, Threads is doomed'. It should have run: 'You can't post ass, Threads will boom'.</p> <p>Despite cut-and-pasting a dying social media site, the Zuck won't be worried. If anyone knows how to transform bland technology into profit it's him. Aside from providing a platform for asinine hot-takes, Threads' main purpose is to hoover up and auction off data. Unlike Twitter, Meta's microblogging venture has strict moderation. When advertisers bore of Musk's manic antics you know where they'll go.</p> <p>Threads' naffness won't stop its success. It's data-scraping fluffily dressed up as substandard corporate twaddle. It's a cringe-inducing privacy invasion.

Now it is no more. Gone from the face of the planet \u2013 never to be seen again. Except it isn\u2019t.</p> <p>Facebook has not disappeared. No, not even the damning \u2018Facebook Papers\u2019 can shut it down. Mark Zuckerberg stood up on stage, and announced that it had changed its name to: Meta.</p> <p>A key part of this new vision for the company is the idea of the metaverse. If it sounds like something out of a sci-fi movie or novel, that\u2019s because it is. The term was first coined by author Neal Stephenson in his 1992 book Snow Crash. Zuckerberg\u2019s only problem is that novel was dystopian. Here\u2019s a brief snippet of Stephenson\u2019s description of the metaverse:</p> <p>\u201cYour avatar can look any way you want it to, up to the limitations of your equipment. If you\u2019re ugly, you can make your avatar beautiful. If you\u2019ve just gotten out of bed, your avatar can still be wearing beautiful clothes and professionally applied makeup. You can look like a gorilla or a dragon or a giant talking penis in the Metaverse. Spend five minutes walking down the Street and you will see all of these.\u201d</p> <p>In fairness, that doesn\u2019t seem unlike the sort of content you see on Facebook today. Compare this to what Zuckerberg wrote in his 2021 Founders Letter:</p> <p>\u201cIn this future, you will be able to teleport instantly as a hologram to be at the office without a commute, at a concert with friends, or in your parents\u2019 living room to catch up. This will open up more opportunity no matter where you live. You\u2019ll be able to spend more time on what matters to you, cut down time in traffic, and reduce your carbon footprint.\u201d</p> <p>The similarities are uncanny.</p> <p>This wouldn\u2019t be the first time that Facebook has been described as dystopian. One Mashable article called the social media giant \u2018Orwellian and Huxleyan at the same time.\u2019 Quite a feat.</p> <p>The \u2018Facebook Papers\u2019 have some pretty shocking\u200a-\u200athough not entirely surprising\u200a-\u200arevelations as well. The leaked documents demonstrate the extent to which Facebook values engagement above all else (including a good experience). For instance, we learned that the algorithm is optimized for low quality content, prioritizes rage over happiness for profit, and promotes extremist content. Most alarming was that the firm failed to reduce disinformation during the pandemic even when given the opportunity. Zuckerberg said no to this, presumably because it would reduce engagement and, in turn, Facebook\u2019s advertising revenue.</p> <p>Let\u2019s not forget all Facebook\u2019s previous scandals. From the Cambridge Analytica kerfuffle to conducting manipulative social experiments in secret.</p> <p>In light of this, the name change makes sense. It deceives you into thinking the company has evolved into a benevolent corporation, when it simply hasn\u2019t. Zuckerberg would much prefer you to think about Meta as a playful universe where you can meet with friends across the globe in virtual reality. Where humans train themselves to sound like heavily discounted robots. Where Facebook is not a Horrid Company.</p> <p>Despite all this: Meta is Facebook, just worse. It doesn\u2019t matter about the new name, the company has not changed. It will still be violating our privacy, daily, on an unprecedented scale. It will still be as reliably scandalous as a Carry On film. It will still be terrible. Plus it will have all the added claptrap of a sub-par holographic universe attached.</p> <p>Share this page: Share on  Share on </p>","tags":["Facebook"]},{"location":"blog/2025/05/01/warning-about-signal-proxies/","title":"A Warning About Signal Proxies in Iran and Other Oppressive Countries","text":"<p>People looking to use Signal Proxies to bypass censorship programs should be aware of a number of issues with Signal\u2019s current proxy implementation. Currently, Signal does not tunnel all application traffic through the specified proxy, which means authorities could still track people using Signal.</p> <p>This has been an issue since TLS proxies were added and has not yet been fixed:</p> <p>The latest version of the Android app (v5.3.12 at this time) fails to route all the traffic to the TLS proxy. There are DNS leaks in the app, and it\u2019s trivial for the censors to learn what IP addresses are connecting to Signal. [...]</p> <p>When the app connects to the Signal server, it first looks up the IP of the Signal servers via DNS, and immediately after, it resolves the IP of the TLS proxy, also with DNS.

Services like iCloud Private Relay and (the unfortunately discontinued) INVISV Multi-Party Relay take inspiration from mix networks like Tor and separate the sender from the destination using two relays operated by different parties, as the name implies. There's separate encryption between each relay as well. MPRs do require you to trust that the two parties don't collaborate to correlate your traffic, so keep that in mind.</p> <p>Typically, the first relay is controlled by the provider (either Apple or INVISV in the previous examples), and the second relay is controlled by another company such as Fastly or Cloudflare. These are big names, so you won't need to worry about reliability.</p> <p> </p> source: blog.cloudflare.com <p>They also provide speed. Private Relay uses the QUIC protocol and as a result it's lightning fast. You wouldn't even know you were connecting to two servers in between your cat videos. The reliability is so good that I forget I even have it on. It even integrates with Safari and gives you a different IP address for different websites, similar to Tor's stream isolation.</p> <p>So why haven't MPRs taken off? INVISV's Pretty Good Phone Privacy service never seemed to make it out of beta. INVISV partnered with Vivaldi, but I can't seem to find any mention of it in the Vivaldi settings or on their website outside the original announcement. INVISV ultimately shut down their service back in June. I hope to see more from them in the future because they were providing something that currently isn't possible to get anymore on Android.</p> <p>That leaves iCloud Private Relay as the only commercial offering that I'm aware of, but it's limited to Apple devices only. Great for Apple users, but everyone else is left high and dry. As is Apple's way, they didn't want any extra inconvenience from using their service, so they restrict you to your real country and timezone. You don't have the same freedom to choose a server wherever in the world you want like a traditional VPN service would allow.</p> <p>There is one more honorary mention: OHTTP. It's a new protocol with a design based on the same principles as those of MPRs: two servers, a relay and a gateway, that decouple the sender from the destination. It's already seeing use by large companies to maintain user privacy for things like Google's Safe Browsing and Apple's new Safari Highlights feature. Unfortunately, it's not quite comparable to MPRs. According to Cloudflare:</p> <p>OHTTP is not a general purpose proxy protocol: it's fit for purpose, aimed at transactional interactions between clients and servers (such as app-level APIs).</p> <p>So it can't cover all the traffic on your device. Still, it's a promising protocol and I hope it becomes more widespread.</p> <p>It really is a shame to see such a promising technology go so underutilized.

It makes me smile not because of the indecision and relative lack of knowledge, but because it wasn't so long ago I was in exactly the same position\u2014perceiving VPNs to be some kind of extreme measure only the paranoid and the criminal resorted to. How wrong I was.</p> <p>In just a few months I've come to realize that something like a VPN is in fact a basic measure one might take in the effort to more freely roam the Internet\u2014tainted as it is by censorship, surveillance and many other forms of state control. So where do you go from realizing these issues if you know them to be the threats that they are to democracy and freedom? You seek to take control.</p> <p>You discover the Tor Project\u2014or rather, you learn more about a network that's been around for years and for years has suffered the type of reputation which only blinds everyday people from its incredible potential for positive change in numerous oppressed countries around the world.</p> <p>At the time of writing there are over 6,300 Tor relays, and I like to think this number will continue to grow steadily. Each one\u2014no matter its uptime, bandwidth or overall reputation, or whether it\u2019s a Guard, Middle or Exit\u2014each one is the direct result of an individual deciding to sacrifice money, time and effort for the cause of fighting for a freer Internet: enabling millions of users\u2014journalists, bloggers, whistleblowers, activists and everyday people like you and I\u2014to communicate anonymously, and therefore safely, wherever we are in the world.</p> <p>Like many others, at first I was unsure about running my own relay. The usual doubts and questions arose: surely it's too difficult; I don\u2019t know much about servers, and it\u2019s surely expensive and beyond my skill-set to configure one as a Tor relay. But then I watched this talk (Invidious Link, YouTube Link) by the articulate, intelligent and passionate Tor Project developer Jacob Appelbaum (if you do nothing else today, watch it).</p> <p>Jacob couldn\u2019t have made a better case for direct action, requesting of the audience:</p> <p>Raise your hand if you think anonymity is something that is good, and you think is a fundamental human right that we should all have... Now raise your hand if you want to do something about it... Now keep your hand up if you\u2019re going to run a Tor relay... Everybody that put your hand down, why aren\u2019t you running a Tor relay? You can do something about it right now.</p> <p>And this is when it struck me, as I hope it struck many others at that talk: Am I doing enough? Can I claim to take this subject seriously if I\u2019m not willing to invest the effort to really be a part of the solution? Not simply to donate money\u2014which of course is still a great way to contribute\u2014but to truly, technologically support the Tor network.</p> <p>It struck me that I have enough money, time and access to the right information to run my own relay. So it begged the question: Why wouldn\u2019t I?</p> <p>At the time of writing my relay has been flagged \u2018valid\u2019, \u2018running\u2019 and \u2018fast\u2019 and is on track to have relayed around 750\u00a0GB by the end of the month.

In the unlikely case that malware is able to exploit other parts of the system and gain higher privileged access, Verified Boot will prevent and revert changes to the system partition upon rebooting the device.</p> <p>Unfortunately, OEMs are only obliged to support Verified Boot on their stock Android distribution. Only a few OEMs such as Google support custom AVB key enrollment on their devices. Additionally, some AOSP derivatives such as LineageOS or /e/ OS do not support Verified Boot even on hardware with Verified Boot support for third-party operating systems. We recommend that you check for support before purchasing a new device. AOSP derivatives which do not support Verified Boot are not recommended.</p> <p>Many OEMs also have broken implementation of Verified Boot that you have to be aware of beyond their marketing. For example, the Fairphone 3 and 4 are not secure by default, as the stock bootloader trusts the public AVB signing key. This breaks verified boot on a stock Fairphone device, as the system will boot alternative Android operating systems (such as /e/) without any warning about custom operating system usage.</p>"},{"location":"os/android-overview/#firmware-updates","title":"Firmware Updates","text":"<p>Firmware updates are critical for maintaining security and without them your device cannot be secure. OEMs have support agreements with their partners to provide the closed-source components for a limited support period. These are detailed in the monthly Android Security Bulletins.</p> <p>As the components of the phone, such as the processor and radio technologies rely on closed-source components, the updates must be provided by the respective manufacturers. Therefore, it is important that you purchase a device within an active support cycle. Qualcomm and Samsung support their devices for 4 years, while cheaper products often have shorter support cycles. With the introduction of the Pixel 6, Google now makes their own SoC, and they will provide a minimum of 5 years of support. With the introduction of the Pixel 8 series, Google increased that support window to 7 years.</p> <p>EOL devices which are no longer supported by the SoC manufacturer cannot receive firmware updates from OEM vendors or after market Android distributors. This means that security issues with those devices will remain unfixed.</p> <p>Fairphone, for example, markets their Fairphone 4 device as receiving 6 years of support. However, the SoC (Qualcomm Snapdragon 750G on the Fairphone 4) has a considerably shorter EOL date. This means that firmware security updates from Qualcomm for the Fairphone 4 will end in September 2023, regardless of whether Fairphone continues to release software security updates.</p>"},{"location":"os/android-overview/#android-permissions","title":"Android Permissions","text":"<p>Permissions on Android grant you control over what apps are allowed to access.

The following guides aim to provide some ways to improve privacy and reduce the default telemetry and data stored by disabling some unnecessary features. Over time, Microsoft adds features to the OS which can sometimes rely on cloud-based services. These features will often require certain types of optional data that is sometimes sent to remote servers for processing.</p> <p>One of the newest examples was called Recall, a part of the Copilot AI feature set. Recall periodically screenshots anything you've seen on your PC in order to show it to you at a later date. These \"helpful\" features create considerable metadata which can be forensically analyzed. In most cases browsing history is sufficient and this feature can be safely disabled. The main concerns with Recall was that the data is stored in a local database that is decrypted when your device is powered on, meaning it is an easy target for hackers if the device ever becomes infected with malware. Recall will not redact sensitive information like copied passwords or financial information from the database, but it does protect against making screenshots of any copyrighted content protected by digital rights management (DRM) systems.</p> <p>Unfortunately, this feature was added without too much thought about the privacy implications of having such a feature enabled by default (which it now no longer is). It is not an isolated example, however. Another example was Microsoft automatically enabling folder backups to OneDrive on new Windows 11 installations without asking for permission.</p> <p>You can enhance your privacy and security on Windows without downloading any third-party tools with these guides:</p> <ul> <li>Initial Installation (coming soon)</li> <li>Group Policy Settings</li> <li>Privacy Settings (coming soon)</li> <li>Application Sandboxing (coming soon)</li> <li>Security Hardening (coming soon)</li> </ul> <p>This section is new</p> <p>This section is a work in progress, because it takes considerably more time and effort to make a Windows installation more privacy-friendly than other operating systems.</p>"},{"location":"os/windows/#privacy-notes","title":"Privacy Notes","text":"<p>Microsoft Windows, particularly those versions aimed at consumers like the Home version often don't prioritize privacy-friendly features by default.

At launch, telemetry could not be disabled in non-enterprise editions of Windows 10.
